## File Structure Improvement Plan

### Proposed Reorganization
```

│   ├── common/         # Shared components across the app
│   │   ├── ui/         # Core UI components
│   │   └── layout/     # Layout components like headers, footers
│   ├── features/       # Feature-specific components

```

### Recommended Refactoring Steps
1. Create proper directory structure
2. Move components into feature-specific folders
3. Separate business logic from UI components
4. Create shared utilities and hooks
5. Implement consistent naming conventions
6. Document component APIs with comments

## Known Issues
- Warning symbol on "eventful newness" page (likely a missing dependency)
- Long files that need further refactoring
- Limited error handling in form submissions
- Missing proper authentication system

## Best Practices Moving Forward
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Document complex business logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling

This documentation serves as a starting point for understanding the current state of the application and planning future development efforts.
