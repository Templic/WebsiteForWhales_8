 address these critical security issues, I recommend:

Review SQL Queries: Locate and fix all identified SQL injection vulnerabilities by:

Using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
Implementing proper input sanitization
Applying input validation before processing any user data
Enhance API Security: Address the input validation issues on API endpoints by:

Adding comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
Implementing proper error handling for invalid inputs
see that the Maximum Security Scan is now fully operational and has analyzed your system with impressive thoroughness. The scan has detected several potential security issues that need attention. Let me summarize what's happening:

Maximum Security Mode Status

✓ Security mode "ALL SHIELDS UP" is active and running
✓ Regular security scans are scheduled every 60 minutes
✓ Initial maximum security scan completed successfully
✓ File scanning completed (702 files analyzed)
✓ API endpoint security analysis completed (159 endpoints analyzed)

Key Security Findings

The scan has detected:

Multiple CRITICAL potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
Numerous HIGH severity issues related to lack of input validation on API endpoints

These findings indicate there are security vulnerabilities in your code that need immediate attention. SQL injection vulnerabilities are particularly serious as they could allow attackers to access or manipulate your database.

Next Steps

To address these critical security issues, I recommend:

Review SQL Queries: Locate and fix all identified SQL injection vulnerabilities by:

Using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
Implementing proper input sanitization
Applying input validation before processing any user data
Enhance API Security: Address the input validation issues on API endpoints by:

Adding comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
Implementing proper error handling for invalid inputs
Adding rate limiting where appropriate
Implement Regular Security Monitoring: Continue using the maximum security scan to:

Monitor for new vulnerabilities
Verify that fixes are effective
Generate reports for ongoing security management
