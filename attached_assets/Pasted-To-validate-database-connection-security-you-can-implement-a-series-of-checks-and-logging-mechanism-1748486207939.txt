To validate database connection security, you can implement a series of checks and logging mechanisms to ensure that any connection attempts to your database are secure and follow best practices. Below is a basic implementation that includes security checks using the existing structure of your SQL injection prevention utilities.

SQL Connection Validation and Security Implementation
Here's a TypeScript implementation that checks the validity of a database connection and logs potential security issues:

// server/security/dbConnectionValidator.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { securityBlockchain } from './advanced/blockchain/ImmutableSecurityLogs';
import { SecurityEventCategory, SecurityEventSeverity } from './advanced/blockchain/SecurityEventTypes';
// Database connection interface
interface DatabaseConnection {
  query: (sql: string, params?: unknown[]) => Promise<unknown>;
}
// Validate database connection and log security events
export async function validateDatabaseConnection(dbConnection: DatabaseConnection): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const result = await dbConnection.query('SELECT 1');
    console.log("Database connection valid:", result);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Database connection failed:", error);
    
    // Log the security event
    securityBlockchain.addEvent({
      category: SecurityEventCategory.DATABASE,
      severity: SecurityEventSeverity.HIGH,
      message: "Failed to connect to database",
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });
    return false;
  }
}
// Usage example
(async () => {
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  });
  const isConnected = await validateDatabaseConnection(pool);
  if (isConnected) {
    console.log("Connection validated successfully.");
  } else {
    console.log("Connection validation failed.");
  }
  await pool.end();
})();
Explanation
Database Interface: This code defines a DatabaseConnection interface to describe how database connections should function.

Validation Function: The validateDatabaseConnection function attempts to run a simple query (SELECT 1) to check if the connection is valid. If the connection fails, it logs a security event detailing the issue.

Usage Example: The bottom part demonstrates how to create a pool of database connections and validate the connection using the utility function.

Implementing this check will help ensure that your database connections are secure and can log failures appropriately for auditing and further investigation.

To implement SQL injection prevention in your application, you can use a middleware approach in your server that checks incoming SQL queries for vulnerability patterns and sanitizes inputs. Below is a complete implementation using TypeScript, which integrates the SQLInjectionPrevention utility we discussed earlier.

SQL Injection Prevention Middleware
Create the Middleware
Use the Middleware in Your Application
Here's how you can set this up:

// server/middleware/sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware.ts
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from 'express';
import { sqlInjectionPrevention } from '../security/advanced/database/SQLInjectionPrevention';
export function sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  const { query, body, params } = req;
  // Combine all inputs to check for SQL injections
  const inputs = {
    ...query,
    ...body,
    ...params
  };
  for (const key in inputs) {
    const value = inputs[key];
    if (typeof value === 'string' && sqlInjectionPrevention.checkForInjection(value)) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid input detected. Possible SQL injection attempt.' });
    }
  }
  next();
}
Integrate Middleware with Your Express Application
Now, incorporate the middleware into your Express application. Typically, you would add it right before your route definitions.

// server/app.ts
import express from 'express';
import { sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware } from './middleware/sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware';
import { Pool } from 'pg';
const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON bodies
// Use SQL Injection Prevention Middleware
app.use(sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware);
// Sample route
app.post('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
  const { data } = req.body;
  // Assuming we have a PostgreSQL setup as per the earlier connection example
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL // Ensure your DATABASE_URL is set
  });
  try {
    const result = await pool.query('INSERT INTO your_table (data) VALUES ($1)', [data]);
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Data inserted successfully', result });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Insert error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Database error' });
  }
});
const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
});
Explanation:
Middleware (sqlInjectionPreventionMiddleware): It checks all incoming request data (query, body, params) for potential SQL injection patterns using the checkForInjection method of the SQLInjectionPrevention instance.
Integration: The middleware is applied before your route handlers in the Express app, ensuring all routes are protected against SQL injection attempts.
This implementation will help safeguard your application from SQL injection vulnerabilities by validating input data effectively. Make sure to modify the database querying logic accordingly, ensuring it utilizes prepared statements when inserting data.

To validate database connection security, aside from checking the validity of the connection (as shown in the previous implementation), you can implement the following types of checks:

Additional Database Connection Security Validations
Connection Encryption Check:
Ensure that the connection to the database is encrypted, which helps prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Credential Validity Check:
Confirm that the credentials used for the database connection are valid and adhere to security best practices (e.g., no hardcoded passwords).

Connection Pool Security Check:
Validate that the connection pool settings are configured for maximum security, such as settings that restrict overly permissive configurations.

Timeout Settings Check:
Verify that timeout settings are applied for idle connections, which can prevent misuse based on lingering connections.

User Privileges Review:
Periodically review the privileges assigned to each database user. Ensure that they have least privilege access necessary for their functionality.

Implementation Example
Hereâ€™s how you can implement these validations in your existing database connection validation utility:

// server/security/dbConnectionValidator.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
export async function validateDatabaseConnection(dbConnection: Pool): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const result = await dbConnection.query('SELECT 1');
    console.log("Database connection valid:", result);
    // Check if connection is encrypted
    const encrypted = await checkConnectionEncryption(dbConnection);
    if (!encrypted) {
      console.warn("Warning: Connection is not encrypted!");
    }
    // Check for other security settings
    await checkCredentialsValidity();
    await checkConnectionPoolSecurity();
    await checkTimeoutSettings();
    await reviewUserPrivileges();
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Database connection failed:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
// Example function to check for encryption 
async function checkConnectionEncryption(dbConnection: Pool): Promise<boolean> {
  // Your logic here to verify the connection is encrypted
  return true; // Placeholder return
}
// Example stubs for additional checks
async function checkCredentialsValidity() {
  // Logic to validate database credentials
}
async function checkConnectionPoolSecurity() {
  // Logic to ensure secure connection pooling
}
async function checkTimeoutSettings() {
  // Logic to confirm timeout settings for idle connections
}
async function reviewUserPrivileges() {
  // Logic to check database user privileges
}
// Usage example
(async () => {
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  });
  const isConnected = await validateDatabaseConnection(pool);
  if (isConnected) {
    console.log("Connection validated successfully.");
  } else {
    console.log("Connection validation failed.");
  }
  await pool.end();
})();
Explanation:
Connection Validity: The existing check for a simple query to ensure the connection is valid remains.
Security Checks: This implementation includes stubs for additional checks like connection encryption and credential validity. You can fill these in with specific implementations as per your setup.
Usage Example: The validation function is called in the context of a connection pool created with your database URL.
Incorporating these checks can significantly improve your application's database security posture.
