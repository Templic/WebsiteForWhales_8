// ContentDependencyTracker.tsx

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

import axios from 'axios';

import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';

const ContentDependencyTracker = () =&gt; {

const [dependencies, setDependencies] = useState([]);

const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() =&gt; {

const fetchDependencies = async () =&gt; {

try {

const response = await axios.get('/api/content/dependencies');

setDependencies(response.data);

} catch (error) {

console.error('Failed to fetch dependencies', error);

} finally {

setLoading(false);

}

};

fetchDependencies();

}, []);

if (loading) {

return &lt;div&gt;Loading dependencies...&lt;/div&gt;;

}

return (

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Content Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

{dependencies.map(dep =&gt; (

&lt;div key={dep.id}&gt;

&lt;Badge&gt;{dep.type}&lt;/Badge&gt; - {dep.title}

&lt;/div&gt;

))}

&lt;/div&gt;

);

};

export default ContentDependencyTracker;

Final Thoughts

By adhering to these guidelines, we can build a robust Admin Portal enriched
with features that improve data management and operations while ensuring a
smooth user experience. Remember to keep the code well-organized and
continuously updated as new utilities are developed or existing ones are
improved.
