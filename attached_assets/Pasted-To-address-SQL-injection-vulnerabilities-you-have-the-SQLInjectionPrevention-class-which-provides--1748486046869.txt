To address SQL injection vulnerabilities, you have the SQLInjectionPrevention class, which provides various utilities to secure your database interactions. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality based on the provided code:

Utilities for SQL Injection Prevention
secureDatabase(db, name): Secures a specific database connection.
getDatabase(name): Retrieves a secured database connection.
secureAllDatabases(dbModule): Registers and secures all database connections from a given module.
generateSecurityReport(): Generates a report on the security status.
runSecurityScan(): Conducts a security scan of the database system.
Additional Security Monitoring Features
Query Logging: Logs all database queries for review.
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitors database interactions in real-time.
Blockchain-based Event Logging: Logs security events to an immutable blockchain.
Modification Suggestions for Enhancements
To improve the utility and add better features for checking SQL injection vulnerabilities without disrupting existing functionality, consider the following modifications:

Enhanced Pattern Detection: Expand the SQL injection patterns to include more advanced detection methods using regex. You can utilize the existing patterns but implement a more comprehensive set, including the ones listed in your inspectSqlVulnerabilities.ts file.

Parameterization Reminder: Implement a reminder or a recommendation system within the utility methods to ensure developers are using parameterized queries.

User-Friendly Reports: Add functionality to generate user-friendly reports that summarize potential vulnerabilities and suggest remediation strategies. This could be integrated into the generateSecurityReport() method.

Real-Time Alerts: Incorporate real-time alerts whenever a suspicious query is detected, leveraging the existing real-time monitoring functionality.

Dynamic Configuration: Allow dynamic configuration for different environments to adjust the sensitivity of SQL injection checks without changing the core code.

Here's an example of how you might start implementing an additional pattern to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in the utility:

// In server/security/advanced/database/SQLInjectionPrevention.ts
class SQLInjectionPrevention {
  private sqlInjectionPatterns = [
    { pattern: /`\s*(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*?\$\{.*?\}/gi, description: 'Template Literal in SQL Query' },
    { pattern: /['"]\s*(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*?['"]\s*\+\s*.*?\s*\+\s*['"]/gi, description: 'String Concatenation in SQL Query' },
    // Add more patterns here
  ];
  public checkForInjection(query: string): boolean {
    for (const { pattern } of this.sqlInjectionPatterns) {
      if (pattern.test(query)) {
        console.log("Potential SQL Injection Detected!");
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
  // Other existing methods...
}
Example Usage
You can incorporate this check in your application wherever you prepare SQL queries:

const sqlInjectionPrevention = new SQLInjectionPrevention();
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userInput}`;
if (sqlInjectionPrevention.checkForInjection(query)) {
  // Handle potential injection case
}
By implementing these suggestions, you can strengthen your utility's ability to detect and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities effectively while maintaining existing functionality.

To enhance your app's protection against SQL injection vulnerabilities, consider implementing the following features:

1. Improved Query Logging
Ensure that all SQL queries are logged with detailed information. This can help identify and audit suspicious activities.

2. Detailed Security Reports
Use your existing security reporting system to generate comprehensive reports on SQL query patterns, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

3. Automatic Pattern Detection
Incorporate automatic detection of SQL injection patterns, using your existing inspectSqlVulnerabilities.ts utility. For example, you can expand the patterns checked during SQL operations.

4. Parameterized Queries
Enforce the use of parameterized queries throughout your application. Update your database interaction code to consistently use secure methods.

5. Real-Time Alerts
Implement a real-time alert system that triggers notifications whenever potentially malicious SQL queries are detected.

6. Mitigation Dashboard
Create a dashboard that provides insights into common vulnerabilities detected in SQL queries, supplying quick remediation suggestions or guidelines.

Here’s how to implement an enhanced SQL injection detection feature by expanding your SQLInjectionPrevention.ts:

// server/security/advanced/database/SQLInjectionPrevention.ts
class SQLInjectionPrevention {
  private sqlInjectionPatterns = [
    // Existing patterns
    { pattern: /`\s*(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*?\$\{.*?\}/gi, description: 'Template Literal in SQL Query' },
    { pattern: /['"]\s*(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*?['"]\s*\+\s*.*?\s*\+\s*['"]/gi, description: 'String Concatenation in SQL Query' },
    // New patterns can be added here
    { pattern: /;\s*--/g, description: 'Commented Out SQL Query' },
    { pattern: /\b(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|EXEC)\s.*?;\s*$/gi, description: 'Multiple Statements' },
  ];
  public checkForInjection(query: string): boolean {
    for (const { pattern } of this.sqlInjectionPatterns) {
      if (pattern.test(query)) {
        console.log("Potential SQL Injection Detected!");
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
  // Other existing methods...
}
Implementations for Logging and Reporting
Ensure that your logging captures necessary information such as query type, user ID, and timestamp. Here’s a basic example:

// in your query execution module
import { sqlInjectionPrevention } from './security/preventSqlInjection';
async function executeQuery(query: string, params: any[]) {
  if (sqlInjectionPrevention.checkForInjection(query)) {
    console.warn("Malicious SQL attempt detected!");
    // Log the attempt for further review
    return;
  }
  // Proceed to execute the query using safe methods
}
Implementing these features will significantly improve your application's resilience against SQL injection attacks.

  private sqlInjectionPatterns: SQLInjectionPatternType[] = [

      }
    }
    return false;
  }
  private handleInjectionDetected(query: string): void {
    console.warn("Potential SQL Injection Detected!", query);

      this.logQuery(query);
    }
    // Real-time alert mechanism (you can expand this)
    this.triggerAlert("Potential SQL injection detected in query: " + query);
  }
  private logQuery(query: string): void {
    // Implement your logging logic, e.g., saving to a file or database
    console.log("Logging query:", query);
  }
  
  private triggerAlert(message: string): void {
    // Implement your alerting mechanism, e.g., send an email or notify via a messaging app
    console.log("ALERT:", message);
  }
  // Other existing methods...
}
// Export the singleton instance
export const sqlInjectionPrevention = new SQLInjectionPrevention();
Explanation:
Logging Queries: The logAllQueries option is enabled by default, logging queries when potential injections are detected.
Real-Time Alerts: The triggerAlert method can be expanded to integrate with any notification system (e.g., Slack, Email).
You can further customize the alert mechanism based on your app's requirements.
You can implement this enhanced SQLInjectionPrevention class in your codebase and utilize it wherever you manage SQL queries. The logging and alert features will ensure you have a proactive approach to monitoring for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
