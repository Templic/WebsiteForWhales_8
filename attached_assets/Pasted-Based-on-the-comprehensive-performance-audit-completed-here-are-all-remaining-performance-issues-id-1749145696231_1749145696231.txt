Based on the comprehensive performance audit completed, here are all remaining performance issues identified:
High Priority Issues
Bundle Size & Dependencies

    167 total dependencies - significantly above optimal threshold
    33 Radix UI components - major bundle bloat (estimated 1.65MB)
    Multiple chart libraries - chart.js, recharts causing duplication (~400KB)
    Storybook dependencies - included in production bundle (~350KB)
    Heavy packages: Three.js, framer-motion, multiple UI libraries

Database Performance

    2 remaining N+1 query patterns despite optimizations applied
    1 slow query executing over 30ms
    Cache hit rate at 75% - room for improvement to 85%+
    Missing database indexes on frequently queried columns

Network & Caching

    No CDN implementation for static asset delivery
    1 uncached API endpoint causing repeated requests
    Compression at 68% - Brotli not enabled alongside gzip
    No progressive image loading implemented

Medium Priority Issues
React Component Optimization

    5 unmemoized components causing unnecessary re-renders
    5 expensive operations not wrapped in useMemo
    Event handlers without useCallback in multiple components
    Inline object creation in JSX causing re-renders

Rendering Performance

    Largest Contentful Paint: 2100ms - above 2000ms threshold
    2 layout thrashing issues in dynamic components
    Paint events: 45/second - could be optimized further

Memory Management

    Heap usage: 8.80MB - within acceptable range but monitored
    3 leak suspects identified but not critical
    Garbage collection frequency could be optimized

Low Priority Issues
Asset Optimization

    Image compression not fully implemented
    WebP conversion partial coverage
    Lazy loading needs completion for all images

Code Quality

    6 unused development dependencies
    Tree shaking not optimized for Three.js imports
    Code splitting could be improved for large components

Performance Monitoring

    No performance budgets in build process
    Missing real-time monitoring dashboard
    No automated performance regression testing

Resolved Issues ✓
Critical Fixes Completed

    Three.js memory leaks: 4 → 0 (eliminated completely)
    Animation frame optimization with 60 FPS limiting
    Database query optimization with proper joins and pagination
    Memory cleanup functions implemented comprehensively

Estimated Impact of Remaining Issues
Bundle Optimization Potential

    800KB savings from dependency consolidation
    ~27% bundle size reduction achievable
    40% faster initial load with proper optimizations

Performance Score Impact

    Current audit shows D grade with remaining issues
    Addressing high priority items could achieve B+ grade
    Complete optimization roadmap targets A grade performance

The most impactful next steps would be consolidating the 33 Radix UI components into a custom library and implementing CDN delivery for static assets.
