 improve media management in your admin portal, you might consider implementing the following features within your existing MediaPage:

    File Organization: Enable categorization and tagging for media assets to facilitate easier management and retrieval.
    Search Functionality: Enhance the search functionality to filter by file type and keywords.
    Upload Progress Indicator: Provide feedback during the file upload process to improve user experience.
    Batch Operations: Allow multiple files to be selected and managed in bulk (e.g., delete, move, categorize).
    Feedback Toasts: Utilize toast notifications for success and error messages to enhance user feedback during operations.

Here's an example of how to implement batch operations and a file organization feature:
Updated MediaPage Code Snippet

// Inside your MediaPage component

// State for selected media and bulk actions
const [selectedMediaIds, setSelectedMediaIds] = useState<Set<number>>(new Set());
const [isBulkActionDialogOpen, setIsBulkActionDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [bulkActionType, setBulkActionType] = useState<'delete' | 'move' | 'categorize'>('delete');

// Function to handle bulk actions
const handleBulkAction = async () => {
  if (bulkActionType === 'delete') {
    for (const id of selectedMediaIds) {
      await deleteMediaMutation.mutateAsync(id); // Assuming deleteMediaMutation defined
    }
    setSelectedMediaIds(new Set());
    return;
  }
  // Other actions (move, categorize) can be implemented similarly
};

// Render bulk action dialog and buttons
return (
  <div>
    <Button onClick={() => setIsBulkActionDialogOpen(true)}>Bulk Actions</Button>
    
    <Dialog open={isBulkActionDialogOpen} onOpenChange={setIsBulkActionDialogOpen}>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Bulk Actions</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>Select an action to perform on selected media files</DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        <Select onValueChange={setBulkActionType}>
          <SelectTrigger>
            <SelectValue placeholder="Select action" />
          </SelectTrigger>
          <SelectContent>
            <SelectItem value="delete">Delete</SelectItem>
            <SelectItem value="move">Move</SelectItem>
            <SelectItem value="categorize">Categorize</SelectItem>
          </SelectContent>
        </Select>
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button onClick={handleBulkAction}>Confirm</Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  </div>
);

Key Features Explained:

    Bulk Actions: The button opens a dialog for bulk actions, allowing users to select a type and confirm operations on multiple files at once.
    Toast Notifications: Use the toast method from useToast for success/error messages during actions.

These changes will enhance the user experience and streamline media management in your admin portal. You can further elaborate this feature set by implementing additional filters and search capabilities as needed.

To enhance the media management features in your admin portal further, here are some elaborated ideas and implementations for File Organization, Batch Operations, and Feedback Toasts:
1. File Organization

Implement a robust file organization system that allows for tagging, categorizing, and easy navigation:

    Tagging System: Allow users to assign multiple tags to media files. Implement a tagging interface where users can create and select tags while uploading or managing files.

    Folder Structure: Create a hierarchical folder structure that allows media files to be organized logically. Users could create folders and subfolders for different media types or project files.

    File Metadata Display: Display file metadata (like upload date, file type, size, etc.) next to each media file in the library for easy reference.

Example Implementation

Add UI elements for folders and tags:

// Assuming you have a Tag and Folder structure defined

const handleAddTag = (tag: string) => {
  setCurrentMediaTags((prevTags) => new Set(prevTags).add(tag));
};

const handleCreateFolder = (folderName: string) => {
  // Function to create a new folder
};

2. Batch Operations

In addition to deletion, extend batch operations to include moving and categorizing files:

    Move Files: Extend the UI to allow users to select a target folder for moving files. Implement logic in handleBulkAction:

const handleBulkMove = async (targetFolderId: string) => {
  for (const id of selectedMediaIds) {
    await moveMediaMutation.mutateAsync({mediaId: id, targetFolderId}); // Assuming moveMediaMutation defined
  }
  setSelectedMediaIds(new Set());
};

    Categorize Files: Extend categorization to allow users to select categories while performing bulk actions.

3. Feedback Toasts

Integrate a toast notification system for user feedback:

    Success and Error Notifications: Using a toast library, create toast messages that appear upon successful or failed batch operations, enhancing user experience and clarity.

Example Toast Implementation

Add toast notifications for actions:

const showToast = (message: string, isSuccess: boolean) => {
  toast({
    title: isSuccess ? "Success" : "Error",
    description: message,
    status: isSuccess ? "success" : "error",
    duration: 5000,
    isClosable: true,
  });
};

// Use this inside your action handlers
showToast("Files deleted successfully.", true);

Overall Structural Integration

When you put this all together, ensure that the UI updates smoothly without requiring a full reload and that the user has the capability to filter and search based on tags and folder structures.
Conclusion

With these implementations in mind, you can significantly improve media management in your admin portal, making it more user-friendly and efficient for your administrators.
