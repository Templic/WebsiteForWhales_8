s

```typescript

// Examples of what the system successfully detects:

// SQL Injection

const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`; // DETECTED

// XSS Vulnerability

return `<div>${userData.name}</div>`; // DETECTED

// Path Traversal

const filePath = path.join('./uploads/', fileName); // DETECTED

// Command Injection

exec(`convert ${imageName} -resize 300x300`); // DETECTED
``` ### AI Model Selection Intelligenc
