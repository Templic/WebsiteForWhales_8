Here are some ideas for enhancing the admin features of your application based on the provided context:

    Enhanced Security Dashboard: Improve the existing security dashboard by incorporating real-time threat detection alerts and visualizations for enhanced monitoring. You can utilize the security scanning tool mentioned in the security_audit_completion_report.md to automatically display vulnerabilities.

    Role Management Improvements: Implement a more intuitive user interface for role assignment under the admin roles and permissions section. You can use a modal for adding/editing roles dynamically.

    Data Security Practices: Integrate more robust data security practices, such as automatic refreshing of encryption keys and implementing secure storage using libraries like cryptography, as suggested in the [user_portal documentation].

    Analytics and Feedback Mechanism: Enhance analytics by employing open-source tools like Matomo for better tracking of user interactions, as mentioned in the admin dashboard section of [user_portal documentation].

    User Activity Monitoring: Add features that allow admins to see user activity logs and influence real-time reports of user actions for compliance and security purposes. Use the recent activities section from the 

    to pull this data together.

    Approval Workflow for User-Generated Content: Implement a streamlined workflow for admin approval of user posts. This could involve setting up a notification system to alert admins when new content needs approval.

    UI/UX Enhancements: Apply a modern UI framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS in the admin dashboard to make navigation easier and more visually appealing.

    Integration of Open Source Tools: Incorporate additional open-source tools for advanced analytics or security scanning, as stated in the respective sections of your documentation.

Hereâ€™s a basic code snippet for implementing a notification system using React that could be added to your admin panel. This begins with integrating notification logic:

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { NotificationManager } from 'react-notifications'; // Example library for notifications

const NotificationSystem = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchNotifications = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/notifications'); // Endpoint to fetch notifications
      const notifications = await response.json();
      notifications.forEach(notification => {
        NotificationManager.info(notification.message, notification.title);
      });
    };

    fetchNotifications();
  }, []);

  return null;
}

export default NotificationSystem;

In this code, a notification system fetches alerts and displays them. You'll need to create an API endpoint to provide notifications. Integrating this into your AdminPortalPage.tsx would enhance user awareness of important events.

You can apply similar enhancements across your admin features to improve functionality and user experience.
