Based on my architectural analysis, I'll plan the first critical chunk of optimizations to address the most severe performance bottlenecks.
First Optimization Chunk: Critical Stability & Hook Fixes
Priority 1: React Hook Crisis Resolution (Immediate - 30-60 minutes)

Root Cause Identified: Invalid hook calls causing "dispatcher is null" errors
Investigation Plan:

    Analyze hook usage patterns across components
    Identify React version conflicts in dependency tree
    Map component rendering order to find hook violations
    Check provider initialization sequence

Fix Strategy:

    Component Structure Audit - Find hooks called outside component bodies
    React Version Consolidation - Resolve multiple React instances
    Provider Order Optimization - Ensure proper initialization hierarchy
    Hook Usage Validation - Implement proper component boundaries

Expected Impact: Eliminate application crashes, restore basic functionality
Priority 2: Sacred Geometry Memory Leak Prevention (30-45 minutes)

Root Cause Identified: Three.js objects not properly disposed across multiple useEffect chains
Optimization Plan:

    Centralized Three.js Manager - Single cleanup function for all geometry types
    Animation Frame Optimization - Proper requestAnimationFrame cleanup
    Particle System Refactoring - Use instanced rendering instead of individual meshes
    Memory Monitoring - Track disposal effectiveness

Implementation Strategy:

// Proposed cleanup consolidation pattern
const useThreeJSCleanup = () => {
  const cleanup = useCallback(() => {
    // Centralized disposal logic
  }, []);
  
  useEffect(() => cleanup, [cleanup]);
};

Expected Impact: Eliminate memory leaks, improve sustained performance
Priority 3: Provider Architecture Memoization (20-30 minutes)

Root Cause Identified: 12-level nested providers causing cascade re-renders
Optimization Plan:

    Context Value Memoization - Prevent unnecessary provider updates
    Provider Consolidation - Combine related contexts
    Children Memoization - Optimize provider children rendering
    State Change Isolation - Prevent cross-provider re-render chains

Implementation Strategy:

// Proposed memoization pattern
const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const value = useMemo(() => ({
    // auth state and methods
  }), [dependencies]);
  
  return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>
    {children}
  </AuthContext.Provider>;
};

Expected Impact: 40-60% reduction in unnecessary re-renders
Priority 4: Bundle Emergency Optimization (15-30 minutes)

Root Cause Identified: Storybook and development dependencies in production
Quick Wins:

    Remove Storybook from production - Immediate 350KB reduction
    Implement tree shaking for Three.js - Target specific imports only
    Chart library consolidation - Remove duplicate chart dependencies
    Development dependency cleanup - Separate dev from production bundles

Implementation Strategy:

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production vite build --exclude-dev-deps"
  }
}

Expected Impact: 25-35% bundle size reduction immediately
Success Metrics for First Chunk:
Stability Metrics:

    Zero React hook errors in browser console
    No "dispatcher is null" errors
    Clean component mounting/unmounting

Performance Metrics:

    Memory usage stabilization - No growth over time
    Bundle size reduction - 800KB+ immediate savings
    Render performance - 30%+ fewer unnecessary re-renders

Validation Process:

    Browser console monitoring - Confirm error elimination
    Memory profiling - Verify cleanup effectiveness
    Bundle analysis - Measure size improvements
    Performance testing - Sacred geometry component stability

Implementation Timeline:

Phase 1 (30 minutes): React hook fixes and component structure validation
Phase 2 (30 minutes): Three.js memory management consolidation
Phase 3 (20 minutes): Provider memoization implementation
Phase 4 (15 minutes): Bundle cleanup and dependency optimization

Total Time Investment: 95 minutes for critical stability foundation

This first chunk addresses the most severe architectural issues preventing stable operation while providing immediate, measurable performance improvements. The focus is on eliminating crashes and memory leaks before tackling more complex optimizations.
