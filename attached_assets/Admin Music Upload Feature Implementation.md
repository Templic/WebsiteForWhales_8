# Admin Music Upload Feature Implementation

## Overview

- Enable site admins to upload audio and video files.
  -
- Supported file types: MP3, MP4, AAC, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, AVI, WMV, MOV.

  Based on the retrieved information from your project "Admin Music Upload Feature Implementation," here is the relevant code snippet that imports and handles file uploads for the specified supported file types:

  from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, flash  
  1. **Flask-Uploads**: This is a popular extension for Flask that helps manage file uploads efficiently and securely. It includes features for handling multiple file types and file storage options.
  2. **Custom Sanitization Function**: You can create a custom Python function to sanitize file names by removing unsafe characters and limiting the file name length. This approach gives you more control over the sanitization process.
  3.
  4. **Python Standard Libraries**: Use the os and pathlib modules to manipulate file paths securely by constructing file paths and normalizing the file name.
  5. **Custom Sanitization Function**: You can create a custom Python function to sanitize file names by removing unsafe characters and limiting the file name length. This approach gives you more control over the sanitization process.
  6.
  7. **Python Standard Libraries**: Use the os and pathlib modules to manipulate file paths securely by constructing file paths and normalizing the file name.



  app = Flask(\__name\_\_)  

  app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = '/path/to/upload/directory'  

  ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'mp3', 'mp4', 'aac', 'flac', 'wav', 'aiff', 'avi', 'wmv', 'mov'}



  def allowed_file(filename):

      return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)\[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS



  @app.route('/upload', methods=\['POST'])  

  def upload_file():

      if 'file' not in request.files:

          flash('No file part')

          return redirect(request.url)



      file = request.files\['file']

      if file.filename == '':

          flash('No selected file')

          return redirect(request.url)



      if file and allowed_file(file.filename):

          filename = secure_filename(file.filename)

          file.save(os.path.join(app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))

          # Database logic to associate file with a specific page

          return redirect(url_for('uploaded_file', filename=filename))

  This code sets up a simple Flask application to handle file uploads. It ensures that only files with the specified extensions (MP3, MP4, AAC, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, AVI, WMV, MOV) are allowed by checking the file extension against a predefined set of allowed extensions in the allowed_file function.

from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, flash

import os

app = Flask(**name**)

app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = '/path/to/upload/directory'

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'mp3', 'mp4', 'aac', 'flac', 'wav', 'aiff', 'avi', 'wmv', 'mov'}

def allowed_file(filename): return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)\[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

def custom_secure_filename(filename): # Implement your custom logic to sanitize the filename import re filename = re.sub(r'\[^a-zA-Z0-9\_.-]', '\_', filename) return filename

@app.route('/upload', methods=\['POST'])

def upload_file(): if 'file' not in request.files: flash('No file part') return redirect(request.url)

file = request.files\['file']



if file.filename == '':

    flash('No selected file')

    return redirect(request.url)



if file and allowed_file(file.filename):

    # Use the custom sanitization function instead of secure_filename

    filename = custom_secure_filename(file.filename)

    file.save(os.path.join(app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))

    # Add database logic to associate file with a specific page here

    return redirect(url_for('uploaded_file', filename=filename))

# Assuming there is a route/function to handle uploaded files

# @app.route('/uploads/')

# def uploaded_file(filename):

# pass

if **name** == '**main**': app.run(debug=True)

        - Sanitize file names to prevent security vulnerabilities.
     5. **Database Integration:**
        - Store metadata about the uploaded files in the database, including file name, type, upload date, and associated content page.
        - Use this metadata to organize and display media files on the front end.

        Since you already have SQLAlchemy and Flask installed and configured, you can dive right into integrating database functionality for your music upload feature. Here’s a streamlined guide to setting up and using a database to store file metadata using Flask-SQLAlchemy:

        **Step-by-Step Implementation**

        **1. Define the Database Model**

        Make sure you have a model in place to represent the file metadata you want to store in your database. As you're dealing with uploaded files, you'll need to capture details like the filename, file type, upload time, and the associated page.

        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy  

        from datetime import datetime



        db = SQLAlchemy()



        class UploadedFile(db.Model):

            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)

            filename = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

            filetype = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)

            upload_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

            page = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)

        **2. Initialize the Database**

        Make sure your Flask app is properly configured to use SQLAlchemy. You need to initialize the database using your application context.

        from flask import Flask



        app = Flask(\__name\_\_)  

        app.config\['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///files.db'  

        app.config\['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False  

        db.init_app(app)



        with app.app_context():

            db.create_all()

        **3. File Upload Route**

        Set up a route in Flask to handle file uploads. This route should save the file to your server's file system and store the metadata in the database.

        from flask import request, redirect, url_for, flash  

        from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename  

        import os



        UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/the/uploads'  

        app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER



        @app.route('/upload', methods=\['POST'])  

        def upload_file():

            if 'file' not in request.files:

                flash('No file part')

                return redirect(request.url)

            

            file = request.files\['file']

            if file.filename == '':

                flash('No selected file')

                return redirect(request.url)

            

            if file and allowed_file(file.filename):

                filename = secure_filename(file.filename)

                file_path = os.path.join(app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)

                file.save(file_path)



                # Save metadata to the database

                new_file = UploadedFile(

                    filename=filename,

                    filetype=file.filename.rsplit('.', 1)\[1].lower(),

                    page=request.form\['page']

                )

                db.session.add(new_file)

                db.session.commit()



                return redirect(url_for('file_uploaded', filename=filename))

        **4. Utility Function for File Validation**

        Ensure that the uploaded files meet your requirements by implementing a validation function.

        def allowed_file(filename):

            ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'mp3', 'mp4', 'aac', 'flac', 'wav', 'aiff', 'avi', 'wmv', 'mov'}

            return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)\[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

        **5. Querying and Display**

        Use SQLAlchemy queries to fetch and display the uploaded files based on their metadata. This will help in organizing and presenting files on the frontend.

        @app.route('/files/\<page>', methods=\['GET'])  

        def display_files(page):

            files = UploadedFile.query.filter_by(page=page).all()

            return render_template('files_list.html', files=files)

        With this setup, you can efficiently manage your file uploads, ensure seamless database integration, and dynamically display your files on the website. Make sure to replace UPLOAD_FOLDER with your actual upload directory and modify routes/templates according to your specific front-end needs.


     6. **Front-End Display:**
        - Develop front-end components to dynamically display uploaded media on designated pages (e.g., Music and Video sections).
        - Ensure responsive playback features are incorporated for various devices and browsers.
     7. **Testing and Optimization:**
        - Test the upload process thoroughly to ensure reliability and performance.
        - Optimize video and audio playback for fast loading times and smooth user experience.

     **Example Code Snippet for Flask:**

     Here's a basic example of how you might set up the upload functionality using Flask:

     from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, render_template  

     from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename  

     import os



     app = Flask(\__name\_\_)



     \# Set upload folder and allowed extensions

     UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/the/uploads'  

     ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'mp3', 'wav', 'mp4', 'avi'}



     app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER



     def allowed_file(filename):

         return '.' in filename and \\

                filename.rsplit('.', 1)\[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS



     @app.route('/upload', methods=\['GET', 'POST'])  

     def upload_file():

         if request.method == 'POST':

             # Check if the POST request has the file part

             if 'file' not in request.files:

                 return redirect(request.url)

             file = request.files\['file']

             # If user does not select file, browser also

             # submit an empty part without filename

             if file.filename == '':

                 return redirect(request.url)

             if file and allowed_file(file.filename):

                 filename = secure_filename(file.filename)

                 file.save(os.path.join(app.config\['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))

                 return redirect(url_for('upload_file', filename=filename))

         return render_template('upload.html')



     if \__name\_\_ == '\__main\_\_':

         app.run(debug=True)

     This setup provides a foundation for allowing authorized users to upload and manage media content on Dale the Whale's website. Further customization can be added to meet specific branding and technical requirements.
2. **User Roles and Permissions**:
   - Implement role-based access control using Flask-Login and Flask-Principal.

   To implement role-based access control using Flask-Login and Flask-Principal for your music upload feature, you can follow these steps. This setup will ensure that only users with specific roles are allowed to access the upload functionality.

   **Step-by-Step Implementation**

   **1. Install Necessary Libraries**

   Ensure that you have Flask-Login and Flask-Principal installed:

   pip install Flask-Login Flask-Principal  

   **2. Configure Flask-Login and Flask-Principal**

   **Basic Configuration**:

   from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request  

   from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, login_required, logout_user, current_user  

   from flask_principal import Principal, Permission, RoleNeed, Identity, identity_loaded, identity_changed, UserNeed



   app = Flask(\__name\_\_)  

   app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'



   \# Setup Flask-Login

   login_manager = LoginManager()  

   login_manager.init_app(app)



   \# Setup Flask-Principal

   principals = Principal(app)



   \# Define user roles

   admin_permission = Permission(RoleNeed('admin'))  

   super_admin_permission = Permission(RoleNeed('super_admin'))



   \# Example user class

   class User(UserMixin):

       def \__init\_\_(self, id, roles):

           self.id = id

           self.roles = roles



   \# Load user for session management

   @login_manager.user_loader  

   def load_user(user_id):

       # Fetch user from data source

       if user_id in users_db:

           return users_db\[user_id]

       return None



   \# Dummy user database

   users_db = {

       '1': User('1', \['admin']),

       '2': User('2', \['super_admin'])

   }



   \# Handle identity loading

   @identity_loaded.connect_via(app)  

   def on_identity_loaded(sender, identity):

       # Set the identity user object

       identity.user = current_user



       # Add user needs

       if hasattr(current_user, 'id'):

           identity.provides.add(UserNeed(current_user.id))



       # Add role needs

       if hasattr(current_user, 'roles'):

           for role in current_user.roles:

               identity.provides.add(RoleNeed(role))

   **3. Set Up Routes with Role-Based Access**

   **Define Routes**:

   @app.route('/login/\<userid>')  

   def login(userid):

       user = load_user(userid)

       if user:

           login_user(user)

           identity_changed.send(app, identity=Identity(user.id))

           return redirect(url_for('upload'))

       return 'User not found', 404



   @app.route('/logout')  

   @login_required  

   def logout():

       logout_user()

       identity_changed.send(app, identity=Identity(None))

       return redirect(url_for('index'))



   @app.route('/upload')  

   @login_required  

   @admin_permission.require(http_exception=403)  

   def upload():

       return 'Upload your music files here'



   @app.route('/')  

   def index():

       return 'Welcome to the Music Upload Portal'



   \# Handle unauthorized access

   @app.errorhandler(403)  

   def access_forbidden(e):

       return 'Access Forbidden', 403

   **4. Test the Implementation**
   1. Start the Flask application.
   2. Test logging in with different user roles to ensure proper access is granted or denied based on roles.

   **Key Considerations**
   - **User Roles and Permissions**: Ensure roles are properly defined and assigned to users. Adjust the roles and permissions in the users_db as per your actual user authentication setup.
   - **Security**: Use strong secrets for your session and consider using more sophisticated methods for handling and hashing passwords in a real-world scenario.
   - **Extending Functionality**: Extend permissions and roles as needed with additional RoleNeeds and permissions specific to different parts of your application logic.

   This setup allows you to control access to your music upload feature, ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles can perform certain actions.
3. **File Upload Form**:
   - Create a structured HTML form allowing file selection and target page designation.
4. **Backend Processing**:
   - Design a Flask route for handling file uploads, ensuring secure processing with werkzeug utilities.
5. **Database Integration**:
   - Utilize Flask-SQLAlchemy for managing file records linking them to specific site pages.
6. **Security and Validation**:
   - Ensure robust file validation and HTTPS implementation for secure transfers.
   -
7. **Enhancements**:
   - Integrate a CDN for better performance, and incorporate a user feedback system to enhance the user experience.

**Task Delegation to Novice Developers**

- **HTML Form Construction** = Create an HTML form with appropriate input elements for file upload and page selection. This form should include options for the admin to select the page where the file will be uploaded. \[Node here to guide: https://www.taskade.com/d/MFR56o7qokg8TJc7#node-66d53e7d-e2fb-4c11-b3a5-45caeb55b731]
