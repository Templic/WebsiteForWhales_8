improve the following into a implementation plan: File Upload Security
Findings:
• File upload functionality exists (MediaPage.tsx references)
• Basic path traversal checks were implemented
• ClamAV integration mentioned in documentation but not verified
Gaps:
• Lack of specific file type validation checks
• No verification of file size limitations
• No checks for proper sanitization of uploaded file names
• Malware scanning validation

Here is an implementation plan to enhance file upload security based on the findings and gaps you've outlined:

Implementation Plan: File Upload Security
Goals:
Enhance file upload functionality to prevent vulnerabilities.
Validate uploaded files more rigorously and ensure safer handling.
Steps:
File Type Validation:

Implement strict validation to ensure only allowed file types can be uploaded. This can include checking file extensions and MIME types.
Create a utility function to check the file extension and MIME type against a whitelist.
const ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];
function validateFileType(file) {
    const fileType = file.type;
    const fileExtension = file.name.split('.').pop().toLowerCase();
    const allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'pdf'];
    if (!ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES.includes(fileType) || !allowedExtensions.includes(fileExtension)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid file type');
    }
}
File Size Limitation:

Set and enforce file size limits on uploads to prevent denial of service. For example, limit files to 5MB.
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5 MB
function validateFileSize(file) {
    if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
        throw new Error('File size exceeds the limit of 5MB');
    }
}
Sanitization of Uploaded File Names:

Implement a utility function to sanitize uploaded filenames by removing unwanted characters and replacing spaces.
function sanitizeFileName(fileName) {
    return fileName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]/g, '_');
}
Integration with ClamAV for Malware Scanning:

Verify ClamAV integration in your application, and if it's not setup, implement it. This requires that the ClamAV server is running and accessible.
Use a library or HTTP request to send files to ClamAV for scanning.
async function scanFileWithClamAV(fileBuffer) {
    const response = await fetch('http://clamav-server/scan', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: fileBuffer
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.isInfected) {
        throw new Error('Malware detected in uploaded file');
    }
}
Implementation in MediaPage.tsx:

Update the file upload handler in MediaPage.tsx to incorporate the new validations before proceeding with the upload.
async function handleFileUpload(file) {
    try {
        validateFileType(file);
        validateFileSize(file);
        const sanitizedFileName = sanitizeFileName(file.name);
        await scanFileWithClamAV(file); // Assuming file is a buffer
        // Proceed with the upload logic (e.g., uploading to storage)
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('File upload error:', error);
        alert(error.message);
    }
}
Testing:

Manually test all upload scenarios to ensure that validations are enforced and proper error messages are displayed.
Automate unit tests for the validation functions to ensure robustness.
Conclusion:
This implementation plan outlines the steps needed to strengthen the file upload security in your application. Make sure to thoroughly test each component to validate that they function as expected and secure against potential threats.

To enhance file upload security, here are the next 7 steps to follow based on your earlier implementation plan:

Next Steps
Update Dependencies:

Ensure that all dependencies related to file handling and ClamAV integration are up to date in your project.
File Type Handling:

Implement a utility for validating supported file types. Include this utility in your upload handler to check against a whitelist of allowed file types.
const ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];
function validateFileType(file) {
    const fileType = file.type;
    const fileExtension = file.name.split('.').pop().toLowerCase();
    const allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'pdf'];
    if (!ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES.includes(fileType) || !allowedExtensions.includes(fileExtension)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid file type');
    }
}
Implement File Size Validation:

Use the validateFileSize function to enforce maximum file size limits:
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5 MB
function validateFileSize(file) {
    if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
        throw new Error('File size exceeds the limit of 5MB');
    }
}
File Name Sanitization:

Incorporate a function to sanitize the uploaded file name, ensuring it does not include invalid characters:
function sanitizeFileName(fileName) {
    return fileName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]/g, '_');
}
Integrate ClamAV for Malware Scanning:

Add a function to interface with the ClamAV service for scanning uploaded files:
async function scanFileWithClamAV(fileBuffer) {
    const response = await fetch('http://clamav-server/scan', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: fileBuffer
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.isInfected) {
        throw new Error('Malware detected in uploaded file');
    }
}
Modify the Upload Handler in MediaPage.tsx:

Update the file upload logic to utilize the validation functions before proceeding with the upload:
async function handleFileUpload(file) {
    try {
        validateFileType(file);
        validateFileSize(file);
        const sanitizedFileName = sanitizeFileName(file.name);
        await scanFileWithClamAV(file); // Assuming file is a buffer
        // Proceed with the upload logic (e.g., uploading to storage with the sanitizedFileName)
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('File upload error:', error);
        alert(error.message);
    }
}
Testing and Validation:

Create unit tests for the validation functions and manually test your file upload feature. Check that error messages are displayed correctly, and validate that files are not uploaded if they do not meet the security requirements.
By implementing these steps, you will significantly enhance the security of your file upload functionality.
