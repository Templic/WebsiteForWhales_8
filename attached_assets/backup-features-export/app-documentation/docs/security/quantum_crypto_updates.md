## Changes Made ### Timestamp Standardization - Standardized all timestamp formats to use `Date.now()` instead of `Date` object

s

- Replaced legacy `new Date()` instances with numeric timestamps for consistency
- Ensured compatibility with blockchain security logging system by using uniform timestamp format ### Type Safety Improvements - Added proper type casting for `crypto.KeyPairSyncResult` to ensure compatibility with TypeScript typing syste

m
- Cast ciphers to appropriate `crypto.CipherGCM` type for authenticated encryption
- Improved error handling with explicit type checking throughout the codebase ### Null Safety Enhancements - Added robust null/undefined checking for all Buffer operation

s
- Implemented fallback values for potentially undefined elements in Buffer.from operations
- Added validation for ciphertext format with explicit error handling
- Ensured all string operations have proper default values to prevent runtime errors ### Error Handling Improvements - Enhanced error detection and reporting throughout the cryptographic operation

s
- Added proper error cascading that preserves original error information
- Implemented consistent error logging format across all cryptographic functions ### Integration with Other Security Components - Ensured proper integration with blockchain security logging through consistent timestamp formattin

g
- Established clean interfaces for interaction with machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Standardized all security event structures for consistent logging and monitoring

## Security Improvements The changes made enhance the security posture of the application by: 1. **Improving Reliability**: Eliminating edge cases where undefined values could cause runtime error

s

2. **Enhancing Type Safety**: Ensuring that TypeScript's type system can properly validate cryptographic operations

3. **Standardizing Logging**: Creating consistent logging and error reporting patterns throughout the system

4. **Facilitating Auditability**: Making security events more consistently formatted for easier tracking and analysis

## Future Enhancements The following enhancements are planned for the quantum-resistant cryptography implementation: 1. Zero-Knowledge Security Proof

s

2. Homomorphic Encryption Bridge 3. Quantum-Safe TLS Integration

4. Advanced Crypto Versioning

5. Secure Inter-Component Messaging

## Technical Recommendations When working with the quantum-resistant cryptography modules: 1. Always use the exported utility functions from the `quantumCrypto` objec

t

2. Ensure that all cryptographic operations are properly wrapped in try/catch blocks

3. Use the typed interfaces (KeyPair, EncryptionResult, SignatureResult) for interacting with the API

4. Maintain the timestamp standardization pattern (`Date.now()`) for all new security events
