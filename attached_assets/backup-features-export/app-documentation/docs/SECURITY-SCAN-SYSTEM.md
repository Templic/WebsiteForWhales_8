## Overview The Security Scan System is a comprehensive, automated security scanning framework that evaluates the application for vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and security best practices. The system operates on a priority-based queue architecture that ensures critical scans are executed first while preventing resource contentio

n.

## Architecture The system consists of the following key components: 1. **Security Scan Queue**: Manages and prioritizes security scan

s

2. **Scanner Modules**: Specialized scanners for different security domains

3. **Reporting System**: Generates detailed scan reports with recommendations

4. **API Layer**: Provides endpoints for scan management and results retrieval

## Scan Types The system supports the following scan types, listed in order of priority: 1. **CORE**: Fundamental security configurations and basic vulnerabilitie

s

2. **API**: API endpoint security validation

3. **AUTH**: Authentication mechanism validation

4. **DEPENDENCY**: Vulnerable dependencies and outdated packages

5. **INPUT**: XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection and other input validation issues

6. **COMPLIANCE**: GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, WCAG compliance

7. **ML**: Machine learning model security and AI security practices

8. **ADVANCED**: Cryptography, secure coding practices, session management

## Scan Modes Each scanner supports two operational modes: - **Quick Scan**: A rapid security assessment that checks for critical issues onl

y

- **Deep Scan**: A comprehensive security evaluation with thorough analysis

## Usage ### Automated Scanning The system automatically runs security scans at scheduled intervals. The default schedule is: - CORE: Every 24 hour

s

- API: Every 48 hours
- AUTH: Every 48 hours
- All others: Weekly ### Manual Scanning To run scans manually, use the provided API endpoint

s:

```javascript
// Run a specific scan

fetch('/api/security/scans/run', {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: {
 'Content-Type': 'application/json',
 },
 body: JSON.stringify({
 type: 'CORE', // Scan type
 deep: true // Deep scan mode
 })
});

// Run all scans

fetch('/api/security/scans/run-all', {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: {
 'Content-Type': 'application/json',
 },
 body: JSON.stringify({
 deep: false // Quick scan mode for all types
 })
});
``` ### Viewing Scan Status The scan queue status can be checked vi

a:

```javascript

fetch('/api/security/scans/status')
 .then(response => response.json())
 .then(status => console.log(status));
```

r:

- Security configuration issues
- Security middleware presence and configuration
- Basic security headers
- Logging and monitoring setup ### API Security Scanner Checks fo

r:
- API endpoint authentication
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Input validation on endpoints
- Response security headers
- API documentation and specifications ### AUTH Security Scanner Checks fo

r:
- Password storage methods
- Authentication token handling
- Multi-factor authentication options
- Session management
- Login/logout security ### DEPENDENCY Security Scanner Checks fo

- Secure storage practices

## Reports Scan reports includ

e:

- Total issues found
- Breakdown by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Passed checks
- Detailed issue descriptions
- File paths and line numbers where applicable
- Actionable recommendations for remediation Reports are stored in the `/reports/security/[scan-type]` directory with timestamps.

## Integration The Security Scan System is integrated wit

h:

- The application's background services
- Audit logging system
- Security monitoring dashboard
- Notification system for critical issues

## Administration Security administrators ca

n:

- Schedule custom scans
- View scan history
- Download detailed reports
- Configure scan parameters
- Set notification preferences for critical issues

## Development ### Adding a New Scanner To add a new scanner: 1. Create a new file in `server/security/scanner

s/`

2. Implement the scanner using the standard scan result interface

3. Update the scan type enum in `server/security/types/ScanTypes.ts`

4. Register the scanner in the scan system

## Troubleshooting ### Scan Failures If a scan fails to complet

e:

- Check server logs for error messages
- Ensure the scanner has access to required files
- Verify environment configuration
- Check system resources (memory, CPU) ### Performance Issues If scanning affects application performanc

e:
- Schedule scans during low-traffic periods
- Adjust scan depth and scope
- Increase the interval between automated scans
- Consider adding more resources to the server
