# Database Security Implementatio

n

 the database security implementation for protecting database operations against SQL injection and other attacks.

## Overview The database security implementation consists of several components: 1. **Database Security Module**: Core validation and logging functionalit

y

2. **Query Validator Middleware**: HTTP request inspection to detect potential SQL injection

3. **Database Configuration Checker**: Regular audits of database configuration

4. **Test Endpoints**: Special routes for security testing without CSRF validation

## SQL Injection Protection The system implements a multi-layered approach to protect against SQL injection: ### 1. Pattern-Based Detection Detects various SQL injection patterns: - **Multiple Statement Detection**: Blocks queries with multiple SQL statement

s (`;`)

- **Dangerous Operations**: Blocks DROP TABLE, DELETE, TRUNCATE operations
- **UNION-Based Injection**: Detects UNION and UNION ALL injection attempts
- **Information Schema Access**: Blocks attempts to access database metadata
- **Blind SQL Injection**: Detects CASE WHEN patterns that could be used for blind injection
- **Time-Based Injection**: Identifies the use of pg_sleep and WAITFOR DELAY functions
- **SQL Comments**: Detects SQL comments that may be used to hide malicious code ### 2. Parameter Sanitization - Sanitizes known input fields to remove dangerous SQL character

s
- Applies to both request body and query parameters
- Focuses on fields likely to be used in SQL operations ### 3. Dynamic Query Analysis - Inspects parameterized values that might be used to reconstruct SQL querie

s
- Detects SQL keywords in parameter values that could be used for injection

## Implementation Details ### Database Security Module (databaseSecurity.ts) Core security functionalit

y:

```typescript

// Key functions:

validateQuery(query: string): ValidationResult

sanitizeParameter(param: any): any

verifyUserAccess(userId: number, resource: string, action: string): Promise<boolean>

assessSecurityConfiguration(): Promise<SecurityAssessment>

logDatabaseActivity(action: string, userId?: number, details?: any): void
``` ### Validator Middleware (databaseQueryValidator.ts) HTTP request inspectio

n:

```typescript
// Middleware functions:

validateDatabaseQuery(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction)

sanitizeDatabaseParams(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction)

verifyDatabaseAccess(resource: string, action: string)

logDatabaseAccess(actionDescription: string)
``` ### Database Configuration Checker (databaseConfigurationChecker.ts) Audits database configuration for security issue

s:

```typescript
// Key functions:

checkDatabaseConfiguration(): Promise<DatabaseConfigReport>

scheduleRegularChecks(intervalHours: number = 24): void
```

## Usage Guidelines ### Best Practices 1. **Always use parameterized queries** via Drizzle ORM rather than constructing queries with string concatenatio

n

2. **Apply the database access validation middleware** to routes that perform database operations

3. **Log all database access attempts** for audit trail and security investigation

4. **Run regular configuration checks** to identify security issues ### Testing Security Measures Use the test endpoints for security testin

g:

```

GET /api/test/database-security/test-validate?q=SELECT * FROM table
``` This endpoint accepts a SQL query in the `q` parameter and returns validation results without enforcing CSRF token or authentication checks, making it useful for testing.

## Logging and Monitoring All database security events are logged to: 1. The security log file in `logs/security/database-security.lo

g`

2. The central security event logging system Events include: - Query validation results

- Access control decisions
- Configuration check results
- Database activity for auditing

## Developer Tools We've provided two scripts to help developers work with the database security system: ### Test Database Security Script Located at `./scripts/test-db-security.sh`, this script provides a quick way to test SQL queries against the security validation syste

m:

```bash

# Run predefined test case

s
./scripts/test-db-security.sh

# Test a custom quer

y

./scripts/test-db-security.sh "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1"
``` ### Database Security Log Viewer Located at `./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh`, this script provides a convenient way to view and filter security log

s:

```bash
# Show the last 10 log entrie

s

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh

# Show the last 20 log entrie

s

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh -n 20

# Show only entries with security risk

s

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh -r

# Show only blocked querie

s

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh -b

# Filter logs containing a specific keywor

d

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh -f "UNION"

# Show all log entrie

s

./scripts/view-db-security-logs.sh -a
```

## Future Enhancements Planned improvements include: 1. Machine learning-based anomaly detection for query pattern

s

2. Dynamic rule-based security policies configurable via admin interface

3. Integration with threat intelligence feeds for known attack patterns

4. Enhanced real-time alerting for critical security events
