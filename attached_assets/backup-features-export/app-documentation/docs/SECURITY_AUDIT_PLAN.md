6. HIPAA (for applications handling health information)

## 5. Audit Tools The security audit uses the following tools: ### 5.1 Custom Security Scripts - `security-scan.js`: Comprehensive security scanne

r

- `security-audit.js`: Security auditing tool
- `security-report-generator.js`: Report generation tool ### 5.2 Open-Source Tools - npm audit: For Node.js dependency scannin

g
- ESLint with security plugins: For static code analysis
- OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite: For dynamic testing (optional) ### 5.3 Manual Testing - Code review by security expert

s
- Configuration review
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Business logic testing

## 6. Audit Frequency and Schedule The security audit follows this schedule: 1. **Quick Security Scan**: Weekly - Automated scanning for critical vulnerabilities - Dependency vulnerability checking - Basic configuration checks 2. **Full Security Scan**: Monthly - Comprehensive vulnerability scanning - Complete dependency analysis - Full configuration assessment - Secret and credential scanning 3. **Comprehensive Security Audit**: Quarterly - Full code review - Thorough vulnerability assessment - Compliance checks - Security control evaluation - Detailed reporting and recommendations 4. **Security Posture Review**: Annually - Review of overall security architecture - Assessment of security program effectiveness - Strategic security recommendations - Security roadmap plannin

g

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities The following roles are involved in the security audit process: 1. **Security Lead**: Oversees the security audit proces

s

2. **Developers**: Responsible for fixing identified vulnerabilities

3. **DevOps Engineers**: Address infrastructure and configuration issues

4. **Product Managers**: Prioritize security fixes in the development roadmap

5. **Security Auditors**: Conduct comprehensive security assessments and validations

## 8. Vulnerability Management The vulnerability management process includes: ### 8.1 Vulnerability Tracking - All vulnerabilities are documented in the issue tracking syste

m

- Each vulnerability includes severity, description, and recommended fix
- Vulnerabilities are assigned to appropriate team members
- Fix progress is tracked and reported ### 8.2 Severity Classification Vulnerabilities are classified using the following severity levels: 1. **Critical**: Immediate action required; potential for significant data breach or system compromis

e

2. **High**: Requires priority attention; potential for sensitive data exposure or significant security impact

3. **Medium**: Should be addressed in near term; impacts security but with limited exploitation potential

4. **Low**: Should be fixed as part of normal development; minimal direct security impact ### 8.3 Remediation Timeframes Vulnerabilities should be remediated within these timeframes: 1. **Critical**: Within 1-2 day

s

2. **High**: Within 1 week

3. **Medium**: Within 1 month

4. **Low**: Within 3 months

## 9. Reporting Security audit reports include: ### 9.1 Executive Summary - Overall security posture assessmen

t

- Key findings and critical issues
- Risk assessment and business impact
- High-level remediation recommendations ### 9.2 Technical Report - Detailed vulnerability description

s
- Technical impact analysis
- Code and configuration examples
- Step-by-step remediation instructions
- Evidence and proof of concepts ### 9.3 Compliance Report - Assessment against security standard

s
- Compliance status and gaps
- Regulatory considerations
- Compliance improvement recommendations ### 9.4 Metrics and Trends - Security posture over tim

e
- Vulnerability trends

s

- Audit report generators
- Vulnerability detection patterns
- Security header configurations
- Input validation rules
- CSRF protection mechanisms
- Content Security Policy templates ### 11.2 Proprietary/Closed Components The following security components are proprietary and should be treated as closed: - Custom business logic security control

s
- Authentication workflow implementation

- Data protection mechanisms for sensitive business data
- Custom security algorithms
- Security dashboard implementation
- User-specific security settings

## 12. Recommended Alternatives For components that are not open-source or have limitations, consider these alternatives: 1. **Authentication**: Auth0, Okta, or Keycloa

k

s

2. **Penetration Testing**: Engage external security experts for periodic penetration testing

3. **Security Champions**: Establish a security champions program within development teams

4. **Security Training**: Provide regular security training for all developers

5. **Bug Bounty Program**: Consider a responsible disclosure or bug bounty program

6. **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Implement RASP solutions for critical applications
