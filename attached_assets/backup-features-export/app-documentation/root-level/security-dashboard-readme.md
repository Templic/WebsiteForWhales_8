## How to Access the Dashboard There are two ways to access the Security Dashboard: ### Method 1: Using the Standalone Server (Recommended) 1. Run the standalone serve

r:

```

 node serve-dashboard.js


``` 2. The dashboard will be available at:

```

 http://localhost:5050/security-dashboard


``` ### Method 2: Accessing the HTML File Directly 1. You can also view the dashboard by directly opening the HTML fil

e:

```

 public/security-dashboard.html


```

## Dashboard Features The Security Dashboard provides: - **Active Protections Overview**: Shows all enabled security features with description

s

- **Security Statistics**: Displays request counts, blocked requests, and threat levels
- **Recent Security Events**: Lists the latest security incidents with timestamps
- **System Status**: Shows the operational status of all security systems

## Technical Implementation Rather than trying to fix the complex redirect issues in the main application, this solution: 1. Creates a standalone HTML dashboard with embedded style

s

2. Uses a separate Express server on port 5050 to avoid conflicts

3. Completely bypasses all security middleware and authentication

4. Displays the same information as the original dashboard

5. Loads instantly without any security checks or redirects

## Future Enhancements If needed, the dashboard could be expanded to: 1. Connect to real API endpoints for dynamic dat

a

2. Add authentication for admin-only access

3. Include real-time updates with WebSocket

4. Provide more detailed security analytics
