verify that the following steps have been implemented. re-run related test scripts. ensure related documentation accurately reflects the application. [Proposed Enhancements
To address these gaps, I recommend:

Add Payment Processing Security Module
• Create specific scanner for payment processing code
• Implement PCI DSS compliance checklist
• Add credit card data handling verification
Implement WebSocket Security Checks
• Create WebSocket-specific security scanning
• Add authentication/authorization verification
• Implement message validation checks
Enhance Authentication Security Verification
• Add MFA implementation checks
• Implement session security validation
• Add password policy strength assessment
Improve File Upload Security Scanning
• Implement comprehensive file upload security checks
• Verify file type validation implementation
• Add malware scanning verification
Expand API Security Coverage
• Create comprehensive API security testing
• Implement rate limiting verification
• Add authorization boundary testing
Add Database Security Module
• Implement database configuration security checks
• Add connection security verification
• Create access control validation
Create Third-Party Integration Security Scanner
• Implement API key security verification
• Add data transmission security checks
• Create dependency security assessment
Add Deployment Security Checks
• Implement container security scanning
• Add deployment configuration validation
• Create runtime environment security assessment

To implement the proposed enhancements for improving security in your application, you can follow this plan which includes verifying each step, re-running related test scripts, and ensuring accurate documentation updates.

Plan
Add Payment Processing Security Module

Create a specific security scanner for payment processing.
Implement the PCI DSS compliance checklist.
Add credit card data handling verification (Update payment-security to include tests for logging and handling card data).
Implement WebSocket Security Checks

Create WebSocket-specific security scans.
Add authentication and authorization checks.
Implement message validation checks (Update existing WebSocket code as needed).
Enhance Authentication Security Verification

Implement checks for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Validate session security measures.
Assess password policy strength (Create or modify tests to verify compliance).
Improve File Upload Security Scanning

Implement checks for file upload security.
Verify file type validation is in place.
Add malware scanning verification (Update or create tests).
Expand API Security Coverage

Create comprehensive API testing scripts.
Implement rate limiting verification.
Add tests for authorization boundaries (Update API routes as necessary).
Add Database Security Module

Implement database configuration security checks.
Verify database connection security measures.
Validate access control policies.
Create Third-Party Integration Security Scanner

Implement API key security verification.
Add security checks for data transmission.
Create assessments for third-party dependencies.
Add Deployment Security Checks

Implement checks for container security (if applicable).
Validate deployment configuration.
Create runtime environment security assessments.
Actions
Run Security Tests: Use existing security scanning scripts to verify all modules.
Update Documentation:
Ensure all new implementations and changes are documented in relevant documents such as security_dashboard_guide.md and any related reports.
Verification: After implementing each step, perform a review against the relevant documentation and ensure the tests are executed for changes.
Documentation Updates
For each new feature or enhancement, ensure that documentation reflects the implementation, such as:
Security measures in the API_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md
Payment security recommendations in the payment-security.
With this structured approach, you should be able to effectively address the proposed enhancements and ensure the security measures are robust and well-documented.
