Based on the security documentation and codebase analysis, here are the main security layers currently implemented in your application:

1. Network Security Layer
HTTPS Enforcement: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection in production
Content Security Policy (CSP): Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
CORS Configuration: Cross-origin resource sharing controls
Security Headers: Helmet middleware setting various HTTP security headers
2. Application Security Layer
Authentication Middleware: Multiple authentication systems including Replit Auth, JWT, and consciousness-based auth
Authorization Controls: Role-based access control (RBAC) with permissions for USER, ADMIN, and SUPER_ADMIN
CSRF Protection: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection (currently disabled globally but configurable)
Rate Limiting: API endpoint rate limiting to prevent abuse
Input Validation: Zod-based request validation and sanitization
3. Data Security Layer
SQL Injection Prevention: Parameterized queries and Drizzle ORM protection
XSS Prevention: Output encoding and content sanitization
Database Security: Encrypted connections and access controls
Session Security: Secure session management and monitoring
4. Advanced Security Systems
Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Advanced encryption methods
Anomaly Detection: AI-powered threat detection
Blockchain Security Logs: Immutable security event logging
Zero Trust Architecture: Zero trust security principles
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Additional authentication layer
5. Infrastructure Security Layer
File Upload Security: Secure file handling and validation
Payment Security: PCI compliance for payment processing
Container Security: Docker security configurations
API Security: Comprehensive API protection and validation
6. Monitoring & Intelligence Layer
Security Scanning: Automated vulnerability detection
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous security event monitoring
Threat Intelligence: Advanced threat detection and prevention
Security Metrics: Performance and security analytics
7. Consciousness Security Framework
Whale Wisdom Protection: Spiritual data access controls
Sacred Geometry Access: Consciousness-gated features
Manifestation Privacy: Privacy controls for spiritual features
Current Security Status
From the logs, I can see that:

Maximum Security Mode is currently active
CSRF Protection is temporarily disabled
Advanced API validation is temporarily disabled
YouTube Security Middleware is active for media content
The security system uses a comprehensive approach with multiple overlapping layers to provide defense-in-depth protection for your cosmic consciousness platform.
