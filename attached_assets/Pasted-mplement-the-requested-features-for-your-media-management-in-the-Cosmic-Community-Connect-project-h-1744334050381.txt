mplement the requested features for your media management in the Cosmic Community Connect project, here's a detailed breakdown of each suggested functionality:
1. Bulk Media Operations

    Objective: Facilitate management actions on multiple media files such as deletion, categorization, and moving between sections.
    Implementation Steps:
        Add checkboxes to each media file row in the media management table.
        Create a toolbar with options for batch actions (e.g., Delete, Move, Categorize).
        Manage the state to track selected media files.
        On action execution (e.g., clicking 'Delete'), send a request to the backend with the IDs of selected media items.
        Handle confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., deletion).

2. Media Analytics Dashboard

    Objective: Visualize statistics related to media usage across different pages to identify popular or underutilized assets.
    Implementation Steps:
        Set up a dedicated page for media analytics, aggregating data from the media usage logs.
        Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create visual representations (graphs, charts) of data such as:
            Number of views per media asset
            Frequency of media usage across different sections
            Trends over time for media interactions
        Create API endpoints that provide aggregate data for the dashboard to consume.

3. Enhanced Media Search Capabilities

    Objective: Improve the search functionality for finding media files based on various criteria.
    Implementation Steps:
        Implement advanced filtering options in the media management UI, including:
            File type (image, audio, video, etc.)
            Date range (uploaded date)
            File size (greater than, less than)
            Text search based on media metadata (title, description, etc.)
        Modify the API endpoint that retrieves media files to accept filtering parameters and apply them in the database queries.

4. Media Version Control

    Objective: Allow administrators to revert to previous versions of media files, enhancing control over media content.
    Implementation Steps:
        Track changes to media files, storing version history in the database.
        Implement a versioning system where each upload creates a new version entry linked to the original media item.
        Provide an interface that displays version history along with an option to restore a selected version.
        Implement backend logic to fetch, restore, or delete specific versions based on user input.

5. Media Usage Reports

    Objective: Generate reports that show where specific media assets are being utilized across the site to prevent accidental deletions.
    Implementation Steps:
        Create a reporting module that scans through media links in various sections or pages.
        Build a report format (in PDF, CSV, or on-screen display) that lists:
            Media asset names
            Pages or sections where they are being used
            Usage frequency metrics
        Implement backend functionality to generate these reports based on the gathered data.

By following these detailed plans, you can enhance the media management capabilities of your application, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience for the administrators managing media assets.
