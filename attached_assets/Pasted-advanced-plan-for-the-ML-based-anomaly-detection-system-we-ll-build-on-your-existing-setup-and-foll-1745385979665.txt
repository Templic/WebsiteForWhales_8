advanced plan for the ML-based anomaly detection system, we'll build on your existing setup and follow these detailed steps:

Advanced Plan for ML-Based Anomaly Detection System
Define Anomaly Types:

Utilize the AnomalyDetectionType enum to define specific anomaly categories relevant to your application, such as authentication, data access, and request frequency.
Integrate Machine Learning Model:

Choose a robust machine learning algorithm suited for anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
Implement the model training process, ensuring it can learn from historical data and improve accuracy over time.
import { AnomalyDetectionModel } from './models/AnomalyDetectionModel'; // Import your model
const anomalyDetectionModel = new AnomalyDetectionModel();
await anomalyDetectionModel.train(historicalData); // Train the model on historical data
Set Up Data Collection:

Ensure that all requests are logged using the existing security middleware to gather data for the ML model.
securityBlockchain.addSecurityEvent({
    category: SecurityEventCategory.REQUEST,
    severity: SecurityEventSeverity.INFO,
    message: 'Request captured for anomaly detection',
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    metadata: {
        requestId: req.securityContext.requestId,
        path: req.path,
        method: req.method,
        user: req.user?.id || 'anonymous'
    }
});
Implement Anomaly Detection Logic:

In the AnomalyDetection.ts, develop the logic for detecting anomalies in incoming requests based on the trained model.
async function detectAnomaly(req: Request): Promise<{ isAnomaly: boolean; reason?: string }> {
    const features = extractFeatures(req); // Function to create feature set from request
    const isAnomaly = await anomalyDetectionModel.predict(features);
    return { isAnomaly, reason: isAnomaly ? "Detected unusual pattern." : undefined };
}
Real-Time Detection:

Once the system captures new requests, trigger { detectAnomaly } asynchronously for each request.
detectAnomaly(req).then(result => {
    req.securityContext.securityChecks.mlAnomalyDetection = true;
    if (result.isAnomaly) {
        securityBlockchain.addSecurityEvent({
            category: SecurityEventCategory.ANOMALY_DETECTED,
            severity: SecurityEventSeverity.WARNING,
            message: 'ML anomaly detection triggered',
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            metadata: {
                requestId: req.securityContext.requestId,
                path: req.path,
                method: req.method,
                reason: result.reason
            }
        }).catch(err => {
            console.error('[SECURITY ERROR] Failed to log anomaly detection:', err);
        });
    }
});
Error Handling:

Implement error handling throughout the anomaly detection process to cater to any issues related to model prediction or data logging.
try {
    // Anomaly detection logic
} catch (error) {
    console.error('[ANOMALY DETECTION ERROR]', error);
}
Continuous Model Improvement:

Integrate a feedback mechanism that allows the model to learn from both false positives and true positives, adjusting its detection parameters accordingly.
Performance Monitoring:

Log performance metrics of the anomaly detection, including response times and accuracy over time.
console.log(`Anomaly detection completed in ${performance.now() - start} ms`);
Testing and Validation:

Write comprehensive test cases for all components of the anomaly detection system, particularly focusing on edge cases in request patterns.
describe('Anomaly Detection Tests', () => {
    it('should correctly identify anomalies in known data', async () => {
        const request = { /* simulated request data */ };
        const result = await detectAnomaly(request);
        expect(result.isAnomaly).toBe(true); // Adjust based on your test data
    });
});
Deploy and Monitor:

When deploying, ensure the application listens on 0.0.0.0 and uses port 5000 for accessibility.
app.listen(5000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log('Anomaly detection service running on http://0.0.0.0:5000');
});
By following this advanced plan, you'll develop a robust ML-based anomaly detection system that enhances your application's security posture by detecting unusual patterns in real-time. Remember to continually test and refine the model to keep it effective against evolving threats.

To continue with the implementation of the ML-based anomaly detection system, here are the next steps to enhance your security middleware and integrate the anomaly detection logic effectively:

Continued Implementation Steps
Update Middleware for Anomaly Detection:
Improve the existing security middleware to include the new anomaly detection capabilities, ensuring it processes incoming requests and applies anomaly detection as configured.
import { createCustomSecurityMiddleware } from './middleware/securityMiddleware';
// Use the middleware with anomaly detection enabled
const securityMiddleware = createCustomSecurityMiddleware({
    enableMlDetection: true,
    enableBlockchainLogging: true,
    enableRuntimeProtection: false,
});
app.use(securityMiddleware);
Feature Extraction for Requests:
Develop a function for feature extraction that creates a suitable feature set from the incoming request, essential for the anomaly detection model to make predictions.
function extractFeatures(req: Request): DataPoint {
    return {
        requestId: req.securityContext.requestId,
        requestPath: req.path,
        method: req.method,
        statusCode: req.statusCode,
        ipAddress: req.ip,
        userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
        timestamp: req.timestamp
    };
}
Enhanced Logging of Anomalies:
Ensure the anomaly detection system logs significant events to the blockchain as security events. This includes detailed metadata for further analysis.
if (result.isAnomaly) {
    securityBlockchain.addSecurityEvent({
        category: SecurityEventCategory.ANOMALY_DETECTED,
        severity: SecurityEventSeverity.WARNING,
        message: 'ML anomaly detection triggered',
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        metadata: {
            requestId: req.securityContext.requestId,
            path: req.path,
            method: req.method,
            details: result.details,
            score: result.confidence,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        }
    }).catch(err => {
        console.error('[SECURITY ERROR] Failed to log anomaly detection:', err);
    });
}
Adjust Sensitivity and Configuration:
Provide options within the anomaly detection configuration to adjust sensitivity and the types of anomalies to be detected.
const anomalyDetectionMiddleware = createAnomalyDetectionMiddleware({
    sensitivity: 0.7, // Example value for adjusting sensitivity
    enabledTypes: [AnomalyDetectionType.REQUEST_FREQUENCY, AnomalyDetectionType.AUTHENTICATION],
    blockRequests: true,
    logAnomalies: true,
});
app.use(anomalyDetectionMiddleware);
Testing Procedures:
Develop comprehensive tests for your anomaly detection logic to ensure it effectively detects anomalies and logs them properly.
describe('ML Anomaly Detection Middleware Tests', () => {
    it('should detect anomalies in requests', async () => {
        const req = mockRequest({
            path: '/api/resource',
            method: 'GET',
            ip: '192.168.1.1',
            headers: { 'user-agent': 'TestAgent' }
        });
        const res = mockResponse();
        await anomalyDetectionMiddleware(req, res, () => {});
        expect(req.securityContext.securityChecks.mlAnomalyDetection).toBeTruthy();
    });
});
Finalize Deployment Configuration:
Confirm that your application listens on 0.0.0.0 on the designated port for accessibility.
app.listen(5000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log('ML-based Anomaly Detection Service running on http://0.0.0.0:5000');
});
With this continued implementation, you'll enhance your anomaly detection system and ensure it can effectively monitor, log, and manage security events related to unusual user behavior. Make sure to test these functionalities thoroughly before deploying your application.
