achieve improvements in media management that are easier, more expansive, and more efficient for your admin portal, consider implementing the following strategies:
1. Enhance the File Organization

    Dynamic Tagging and Categorization: Implement a user interface to allow admins to easily add and manage tags and categories for media assets. This could be achieved through a modal dialog similar to the bulk actions dialog already in place.

Code Snippet

Here's a basic implementation to add tagging within the MediaPage:

const [tagsInput, setTagsInput] = useState<string>("");

const handleAddTags = async () => {
  const tags = tagsInput.split(",").map(tag => tag.trim());
  await addTagsMutation.mutateAsync({ mediaId: selectedMediaId, tags });
  setTagsInput("");
};

// Render tagging input
<Label>
  Tags:
  <Input 
    value={tagsInput} 
    onChange={(e) => setTagsInput(e.target.value)} 
    placeholder="Add tags, separated by commas" 
  />
</Label>
<Button onClick={handleAddTags}>Add Tags</Button>

2. Batch Operations

In your current batch operations setup, expand functionality to include moving files between folders or changing categories. This will provide a better way to manage groups of files.
Code Snippet

Integrate a dropdown for selecting target folders during bulk move operation:

<Select onValueChange={setTargetFolderId}>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder="Select a folder" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    {folders.map(folder => (
      <SelectItem key={folder.id} value={folder.id}>{folder.name}</SelectItem>
    ))}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>

// In handleBulkAction
if (bulkActionType === 'move') {
  await handleBulkMove(targetFolderId); // Use the above function
}

3. Feedback Toasts

Integrate a consistent toast notification system to inform users of action outcomes, such as successful uploads, deletions, or errors.
Code Snippet

Utilize your existing toast hook to notify users:

import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";

// Show toast after action
showToast("Media files moved successfully", true);

4. Additional Features

    Search and Filter: Implement a search bar to filter media by name, type, or tags.
    Sort Functions: Add sorting options for files based on upload date, type, or name, to enhance organization.
    Performance Analytics: Include a feature to analyze how often media assets are accessed or downloaded, aiding in content management strategies.

Conclusion

By enhancing file organization, improving batch operations, and integrating feedback mechanisms, you can make the media management system easier and more efficient for users. Apply these improvements incrementally and assist users with clear visuals and notifications to ensure a smooth experience.
