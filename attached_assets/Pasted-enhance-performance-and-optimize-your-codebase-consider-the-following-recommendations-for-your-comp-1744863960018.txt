enhance performance and optimize your codebase, consider the following recommendations for your components and services:

1. Optimize Component Performance
Implement lazy loading for components that are not immediately required. This limits the initial load time and improves responsiveness.

For example, if you have heavy components in SecurityDashboard.tsx, you can utilize Reactâ€™s Suspense and lazy() for better performance:

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
const SecurityDashboard = lazy(() => import('./SecurityDashboard'));
const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <SecurityDashboard />
        </Suspense>
    );
};
2. Efficient State Management
Instead of maintaining multiple pieces of state in your components, consider using a global state management solution (like Context API or Zustand) for shared states. This minimizes the number of re-renders and can improve performance significantly.

3. Use Memoization
Utilize React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components or functions. For example:

import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
const MyComponent = ({ value }) => {
    const calculateValue = useCallback(() => {
        return expensiveCalculation(value);
    }, [value]);
    return (
        <div>{calculateValue()}</div>
    );
};
4. Cleanup on Component Unmount
In components where you might set up subscriptions or timeouts, make sure to clean these up in a useEffect cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        // Action here
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer); // Cleanup function
}, []);
5. Optimize Network Requests
Batch your network requests where possible, or make use of caching mechanisms to reduce the load on your server and improve response times. For example, if you're fetching data in the PerformanceOptimizations component, consider consolidating multiple API calls into a single request.

6. Secure Configuration Options
In PerformanceOptimizations, review the security settings to ensure only essential features are enabled. You may also automate testing for enabled features to ensure they are correctly applied.

7. Regularly Analyze and Monitor Performance
Incorporate logging and performance monitoring within your application. This helps in identifying components that may be underperforming and need optimization. Tools like Lighthouse or React Profiler can provide insights into your app's performance.
