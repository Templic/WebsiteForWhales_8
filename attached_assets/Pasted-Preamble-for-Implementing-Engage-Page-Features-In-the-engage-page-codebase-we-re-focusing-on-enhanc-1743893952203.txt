Preamble for Implementing Engage Page Features
In the engage page codebase, we're focusing on enhancing user interaction by implementing two new components: SocialMediaLinks and FanReactions. Additionally, we will restructure the main content flow by relocating the FeaturedMerchandise component to the bottom of the page.
This process will involve the following steps:
1.	Create New Components:
o	Develop a 
•  component to provide users with links to our social media profiles, encouraging them to follow our updates. 
•  Develop a 
1.	
o	component that displays testimonials or comments from our fans, fostering a sense of community.
2.	Update Engage Page Structure:
o	Import these two newly created components into the main engage page.
o	Ensure that the FeaturedMerchandise component is moved to the end of the content, promoting other engagement areas higher in the hierarchy.
3.	Code Implementation:
o	Implement the code for the new components based on standard functional component structure in React.
o	Update the layout of the engage page to include these components and maintain consistency with existing design patterns from the project.
By following this structured approach, we will enhance user engagement on the page while keeping the code clean and maintainable. Here is the implemented code for the new components and an updated engage page structure.
Code Implementation
SocialMediaLinks.tsx
import React from 'react';
const SocialMediaLinks = () => {
  return (
    <div className="social-media-links">
      <h3>Follow Us</h3>
      <a href="https://facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>

      <a href="https://instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>
    </div>
  );
};
export default SocialMediaLinks;
FanReactions.tsx
import React from 'react';
const FanReactions = () => {
  return (
    <div className="fan-reactions">
      <h3>What Our Fans Say</h3>
      <p>"This is the best experience I've ever had!"</p>
      <p>"Absolutely love the community!"</p>
      <p>"Can't wait for the next event!"</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default FanReactions;
Updated EngagePage.tsx
import React from 'react';
import Header from '@/components/layout/Header';
import Footer from '@/components/layout/Footer';
import Button from '@/components/common/Button';
import Modal from '@/components/common/Modal';
import SocialMediaLinks from '@/components/common/SocialMediaLinks';

      <Header />
      <main>
        <h1>Engage with Us</h1>
        <Button onClick={handleEngageClick}>Join Now</Button>
        <Modal show={isModalVisible} onClose={handleCloseModal}>
          {/* Modal content */}
        </Modal>
        
        {/* New Components */}
        <SocialMediaLinks />
        <FanReactions />
        
        {/* Move Featured Merchandise to the end */}
        <FeaturedMerchandise />
