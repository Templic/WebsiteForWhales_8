- **Authentication Bypass**: Merkaba consciousness-enhanced auth vulnerability scanning
- **SQL Injection**: Comprehensive database security analysis
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery vulnerability detection
- **Data Leak Prevention**: Sensitive data exposure analysis **Unique Features:**
- **Healing Frequencies**: Uses specific Hz frequencies for consciousness alignment
- **Quantum Fixes**: Consciousness-guided solution generation
- **Cascade Effect Mapping**: Tracks how one vulnerability enables others
- **Merkaba Solutions**: Sacred geometry-inspired security solutions ### 2. PCI Compliance Monitoring Syste

m
**Location**: `reports/compliance/` directory **What it monitors:**
- Payment card industry compliance requirements
- Automated compliance reporting and tracking
- Log review processes for security events
- Regular compliance assessment scheduling **Key Benefits:**
- **Automated Compliance**: Continuous monitoring of PCI requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time security posture evaluation
- **Report Generation**: Detailed compliance status reports
- **Alert System**: Proactive notification of compliance issues ### 3. Enhanced CSRF Protectio

n
**Implementation across multiple endpoints** **Security Improvements:**
- Enhanced token validation mechanisms
- Improved security context integration
- Better error handling for security failures
- Comprehensive request validation

## Restoration Priority 1. **Critical**: Advanced Security Root Cause Tracer (foundation for all securit

y)

2. **High**: PCI Compliance System (regulatory compliance)

3. **Medium**: CSRF enhancements (request security)

## Implementation Guide 1. Deploy security tracer: `npx tsx advanced-security-root-cause-tracer.t

s`

2. Configure compliance monitoring schedules

3. Integrate CSRF protection into all API endpoints

4. Set up automated security scanning workflows
