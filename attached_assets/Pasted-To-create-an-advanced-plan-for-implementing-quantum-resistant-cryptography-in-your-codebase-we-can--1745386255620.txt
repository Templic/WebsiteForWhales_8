To create an advanced plan for implementing quantum-resistant cryptography in your codebase, we can break it down into key phases:

Phase 1: Define Requirements
Document the purpose of implementing quantum-resistant cryptography.
Identify Use Cases: Determine specific use cases such as secure messaging, data encryption, and digital signatures.
Phase 2: Select Quantum-Resistant Algorithms
Research available quantum-resistant algorithms to choose from various types:
Lattice-based (e.g., NTRU, Ring-LWE)
Hash-based (e.g., SPHINCS)
Code-based (e.g., McEliece)
Implementation of specific algorithms per use case by leveraging existing classes in your codebase.
Phase 3: Key Management
Key Generation: Utilize QuantumKeyGenerator.generateKeyPair to create key pairs.
Key Storage: Ensure secure storage mechanisms for private keys.
Key Rotation: Plan for regular rotation of keys to enhance security.
Phase 4: Implement Core Functions
Develop reusable functions around core tasks:
Encryption (see QuantumEncryption.encrypt)
Decryption (see QuantumEncryption.decrypt)
Signing (see QuantumSignature.sign)
Verification (see QuantumSignature.verify)
Phase 5: Establish Secure Multi-Party Computation
Utilize SecureMultiPartyComputation to handle computations securely.
Design specifications for inputs and operations supported.
Phase 6: Testing and Simulation
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for all cryptographic functions to ensure correctness.
Simulation: Create scenarios mimicking various attack vectors including quantum attacks to test resilience.
Phase 7: Documentation and Best Practices
Use JSDoc comments to enhance the documentation of all implemented functions and classes.
Create user guides that explain how to use the quantum-resistant features.
Phase 8: Deployment on Replit
Ensure the implementation is deployable in the Replit environment.
Review and use environment variables for sensitive information like keys.
Example Code Initialization
To kick things off, here is how you might begin implementing the key generation and encryption processes. This can serve as a reference for your specific usage:

import { quantumCrypto } from './QuantumResistantCrypto';
const keyPair = quantumCrypto.generateKeyPair();
const dataToEncrypt = "Sensitive data";
const encryptedData = quantumCrypto.encrypt(dataToEncrypt, keyPair.publicKey);
console.log("Encrypted Data:", encryptedData);
By following these phases and example code, you can lay the groundwork for robust quantum-resistant cryptography within your application.
