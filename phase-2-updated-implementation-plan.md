      patternComplexity: this.assessComplexityPreference(interactions),
      culturalResonance: this.measureCulturalAffinity(interactions),
      whaleWisdomConnection: this.evaluateMarineConsciousness(interactions)
    };
    
    return this.synthesizeConsciousnessLevel(metrics);
  }
}
```

#### AI-Enhanced Pattern Selection
```typescript
class IntelligentPatternEngine {
  async selectOptimalPattern(
    userProfile: ConsciousnessProfile,
    pageContext: PageContext,
    astronomicalData: AstronomicalData
  ): Promise<OptimizedPattern> {
    
    const aiRequest = {
      userConsciousness: userProfile.level,
      culturalPreferences: userProfile.culturalResonance,
      pageType: pageContext.type,
      cosmicAlignment: astronomicalData.cosmicAlignment,
      whaleWisdomActive: userProfile.whaleConnectionStrength > 0.7
    };
    
    const aiResponse = await this.consciousnessAI.optimizePattern(aiRequest);
    return this.validateAndAuthenticate(aiResponse);
