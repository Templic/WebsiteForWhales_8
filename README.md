## Repository Structure

```

## Component Organization

### Active Components
Components are organized into feature-specific directories that align with their primary functions in the application. Each feature directory contains components specific to that feature, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.

### Deprecated Components
- **Music Components:** Components under `components/music/` are marked as deprecated and should not be used in new development. Their functionality has been moved to the `features/audio/` directory, which contains the current audio-related components.
- **Future Removal:** These components are retained for backward compatibility but are scheduled for removal in future versions.

### Imported Components
The `components/imported/` directory contains components that were imported from other sources:
- **v0 Components:** From the original application version
- **Lovable Components:** From the lovable.dev platform

## Documentation Standards

All components should follow the documentation standards outlined in the [Component Documentation Guide](docs/COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md):

- **File Header:** Each file should have a header with metadata
- **Component JSDoc:** Each component should have detailed JSDoc comments
- **Props Documentation:** Props should be documented with types and descriptions
- **Deprecation Notices:** Deprecated components should have clear migration guidance

Example of properly documented component:

```tsx
/**
 * @file ComponentName.tsx
 * @description Brief description of the component's purpose
 * @author [Original Author]
 * @created [Creation Date]
 * @updated [Last Update Date]
 * @status [Active | Deprecated | Experimental]
 */

/**
 * ComponentName
 * 
 * Detailed description of what the component does and its purpose.
 * 
 * @example
 * <ComponentName prop1="value" prop2={value2} />
 */
```

## Routing

The application uses the `wouter` library for client-side routing. All routes are defined in `App.tsx`. Some routes are marked as commented out, which indicates they are deprecated but kept for reference.

Key route categories:
- **Main Pages:** Home, About, Contact, etc.
- **Music & Experience:** Music release, archived music, cosmic experiences
- **Shop Routes:** Product browsing, cart, checkout
- **Admin Routes:** Admin portal, analytics, user management
- **Demo Pages:** Component previews and tests

For a complete list of routes, see [Routes Documentation](docs/ROUTES.md).

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utilities for managing the codebase:

- **Component Analysis:** `analyze-similar-components.js` identifies similar components for consolidation
- **Component Migration:** `component-migration.js` helps with migrating components to new locations
- **Component Consolidation:** `consolidate-components.js` merges similar components
- **Repository Reorganization:** `repository-reorganization.js` maintains the directory structure

## Development Guidelines

1. **New Components:** Place new components in their corresponding feature directories
2. **Deprecating Components:** Instead of deleting components, mark them as deprecated using comments
3. **Routing Changes:** When deprecating routes, comment them out rather than removing them
4. **Documentation:** Keep all README files up to date with the latest changes
5. **Testing:** Test both active and recently modified components
6. **Security:** Follow security best practices outlined in the security documentation
7. **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies using the provided scripts

## Agentic Development

The project leverages Replit's Agentic vibe-coding approach for enhanced development:

1. **Collaborative AI Assistance:** Work with the Replit Agent to accelerate development
2. **Vibe-Driven Component Creation:** Create components by describing their vibe and functionality
3. **Documentation Generation:** Automatically generate comprehensive documentation
4. **Performance Optimization:** Leverage AI insights for optimizing critical code
5. **Creative Exploration:** Focus on creative aspects while the Agent handles implementation details

See the [Agentic Vibe-Coding](docs/replit-integration/AGENTIC_VIBE_CODING.md) documentation for details.

## Backend Integration

The application uses an Express backend that connects to a PostgreSQL database. Key backend files:

- **server/routes.ts:** API route definitions
- **server/storage.ts:** Data storage interface
- **shared/schema.ts:** Shared data model definitions

## Database Updates

To update the database structure:
1. Add necessary Drizzle models and relations to `shared/schema.ts`
2. Update `server/storage.ts` to reflect your changes
3. Use `npm run db:push` to apply schema changes

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using the package manager
3. Start the development server using the workflow "Start application"
4. Access the application at the provided URL

## Recent Documentation Updates

Recently added comprehensive documentation on Replit's Agentic vibe-coding methodology:

1. **Philosophy and Approach:** Detailed explanation of the Agentic vibe-coding concept and its benefits
2. **Practical Component Guide:** How to use the Agent effectively for component development
3. **Real Success Stories:** Case studies showing before-and-after improvements with the Agent
4. **Practical Use Cases:** Specific scenarios for leveraging the Agent in daily development

These documents provide a framework for effectively using the Replit Agent to enhance development productivity, code quality, and creative exploration in the project.
