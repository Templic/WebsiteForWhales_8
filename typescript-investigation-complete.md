### ✅ Module Resolution Issues (Fixed)
- **use-auth.tsx**: Fixed relative path imports for toast functionality
- **AdminEditor.tsx**: Corrected module paths for hooks and UI components  
- **ContentPreview.tsx**: Fixed queryClient import path
- **Status**: 4 critical import path issues resolved

### ✅ Export Pattern Issues (Fixed)
- **security-utilities-enhanced.ts**: Separated type and value exports
- **retrospective-interdependency-analysis.ts**: Fixed isolatedModules conflicts
- **advanced-risk-analysis-system.ts**: Corrected severity type assignment
- **Status**: Export declaration conflicts resolved

### ✅ Type Assignment Issues (Fixed)
- **comprehensive-database-validator.ts**: Fixed boolean/undefined type conflicts
