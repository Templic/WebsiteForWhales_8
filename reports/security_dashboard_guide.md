# Security Dashboard User Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Security Dashboard to manage and monitor the security features of the application.

## Accessing the Security Dashboard

The Security Dashboard is accessible to administrators and can be found at:

```
/admin/security
```

You must be logged in with administrator privileges to access this page.

## Dashboard Overview

The Security Dashboard is divided into several tabs:

### 1. Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level summary of the application's security status:

- **Security Score**: A calculated score based on your security settings and scan results
- **Active Settings**: Number of security settings currently enabled
- **Recommended Settings**: Settings that are recommended but not enabled
- **Recent Issues**: Summary of recently detected security issues

### 2. Settings Tab

The Settings tab allows you to configure security features:

- **Content Security Policy**: Controls allowed sources for content loading
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Forces all connections to use HTTPS
- **Audio Download Protection**: Prevents unauthorized downloading of audio files
- **Advanced Bot Protection**: Detects and blocks malicious bot activity
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Requires second verification factor for login

To toggle a setting:
1. Find the setting you want to change
2. Click the toggle switch to enable or disable it
3. The change will be applied immediately and logged

### 3. Scans Tab

The Scans tab manages security vulnerability scanning:

- **Run New Scan**: Initiates a new security scan of the application
- **Latest Scan Results**: Shows issues found in the most recent scan
- **Scan History**: Lists previous scans with summary information

Issues are categorized by severity:
- Critical: Requires immediate attention
- High: Should be addressed as soon as possible
- Medium: Should be planned for resolution
- Low: Should be considered for future improvements

### 4. Events Tab

The Events tab shows a history of security-related events:

- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Security setting changes
- Security scans
- Other security-related activities

Each event includes:
- Timestamp
- Event type
- User who performed the action (if applicable)
- Additional context such as IP address

## Common Tasks

### Running a Security Scan

1. Navigate to the Scans tab
2. Click the "Run New Scan" button
3. Wait for the scan to complete (this may take a few minutes)
4. Review the results in the "Latest Scan Results" section

### Updating Security Settings

1. Navigate to the Settings tab
2. Find the setting you want to modify
3. Toggle the switch to enable or disable the setting
4. The change will be applied immediately

### Responding to Security Issues

When security issues are detected:

1. Review the issue details in the Scans tab
2. Prioritize issues based on severity
3. Review the recommendation provided for each issue
4. Address the issues in the codebase
5. Run a new scan to verify the issues have been resolved

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scans**: Run security scans at least weekly or after significant code changes
- **Review Events**: Regularly review the Events tab for suspicious activities
- **Follow Recommendations**: Enable all recommended security settings
- **Address Issues Promptly**: Resolve high and critical severity issues as soon as possible
- **Document Changes**: Keep track of security changes and their impact

## Troubleshooting

### Security Scan Failures

If a security scan fails to complete:

1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Ensure the application has access to scan all necessary files
3. Try running the scan again

### Security Setting Issues

If enabling a security setting causes application problems:

1. Check the application logs for errors
2. Review the specific requirements for the security setting
3. Make necessary code adjustments to support the security feature
4. If necessary, temporarily disable the setting while making fixes

## Getting Help
