# Security Best Practices Guide

## Overview
This guide provides best practices for maintaining and enhancing the security of the application. It covers coding standards, operational guidelines, and security considerations for developers and administrators.

## Secure Coding Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Storage**: Always use bcrypt with appropriate cost factor (currently set to 12) for password hashing.
- **Session Management**: Use secure, HTTP-only, SameSite cookies with appropriate expiration.
- **Authorization Checks**: Implement authorization checks at both the route and business logic levels.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions necessary for each user role.

### Input Validation & Output Encoding
- **Server-Side Validation**: Never rely solely on client-side validation; validate all input on the server.
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize user inputs appropriate to their context (HTML, SQL, etc.).
- **Output Encoding**: Always encode data before outputting to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Content-Type Headers**: Set appropriate Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers.

### Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
- **Database Privileges**: Use separate database users with minimal required privileges.
- **Connection Security**: Ensure database connections are encrypted and credentials are securely stored.
- **Query Limiting**: Implement limits on query results to prevent DoS attacks.

### File Operations
- **File Uploads**: Validate file types, scan for malware, and store in a location outside the web root.
- **File Paths**: Use path normalization and restrict access to the filesystem.
- **File Permissions**: Set appropriate permissions on server files and directories.
- **Temporary Files**: Securely manage and clean up temporary files.

### API Security
- **API Authentication**: Use secure API keys or OAuth tokens with proper expiration.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints.
- **Input Validation**: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all API inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Return appropriate error codes without exposing implementation details.

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not in code.
- **Configuration Validation**: Validate configuration values on application startup.
- **Production Settings**: Ensure development settings are not used in production.
- **Secrets Management**: Use a secure method for managing secrets and credentials.

## Operational Security

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Logging**: Log all security-relevant events (authentication, authorization, etc.).
- **Log Protection**: Secure logs against unauthorized access and tampering.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities and security events.
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review logs for security incidents.

### Backup & Recovery
- **Regular Backups**: Configure automated backups using the provided scripts.
- **Backup Testing**: Periodically test the restoration process to ensure backups are valid.
- **Secure Storage**: Store backups securely, preferably encrypted and off-site.
- **Backup Rotation**: Implement the backup rotation policy to maintain adequate history.

### Update Management
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- **Security Patches**: Prioritize security-related patches and updates.
- **Change Management**: Follow a formal change management process for updates.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Test updates thoroughly before deploying to production.

### Incident Response
- **Incident Plan**: Develop and maintain a security incident response plan.
- **Contact Information**: Maintain updated contact information for security personnel.
- **Forensic Readiness**: Prepare systems for potential forensic investigation.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct thorough reviews after security incidents.

## Security Controls

### Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Implement and maintain appropriate firewall rules.
- **Network Segmentation**: Segment the network to limit the impact of breaches.
- **TLS Configuration**: Use secure TLS configurations for all encrypted connections.
- **Public Exposure**: Minimize the attack surface by limiting publicly exposed services.

### Access Control
- **Account Management**: Regularly review user accounts and privileges.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for administrative access.
- **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password requirements.
- **Session Timeout**: Implement appropriate session timeouts for idle users.

### Content Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Maintain a strict CSP to prevent XSS and other attacks.
- **Subresource Integrity**: Use SRI for external resources when possible.
- **Cross-Origin Policies**: Implement appropriate CORS policies to restrict access.
- **Embedded Content**: Securely handle embedded content from external sources.

### Security Testing
- **Regular Scanning**: Schedule regular automated security scans.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct periodic penetration testing by qualified personnel.
- **Code Reviews**: Include security considerations in code reviews.
- **Vulnerability Tracking**: Track and address identified vulnerabilities promptly.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Dashboard Usage
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the Security Dashboard to authorized personnel only.
- **Settings Management**: Review the impact of security settings before enabling/disabling.
- **Scan Scheduling**: Run security scans during off-peak hours to minimize performance impact.
- **Alert Configuration**: Configure security alerts to appropriate channels.

### Backup System Usage
- **Manual Backups**: Use the following command to create a manual backup:
  ```
  ./scripts/backup.sh
  ```
- **Customized Backups**: For customized backups, use command-line options:
  ```
  ./scripts/backup.sh -o custom_directory -n  # No encryption
  ./scripts/backup.sh -d  # Database only
  ./scripts/backup.sh -a  # Application only
  ```
- **Restoration**: To restore from a backup, use:
  ```
  ./scripts/restore.sh -b backups/backup-filename.tar.gz
  ```
- **Selective Restoration**: For selective restoration:
  ```
  ./scripts/restore.sh -b backups/backup-filename.tar.gz -d  # Database only
  ./scripts/restore.sh -b backups/backup-filename.tar.gz -a  # Application only
  ```

### Security Logging
- **Log Locations**: Security logs are stored in the `logs` directory.
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are automatically rotated to prevent excessive disk usage.
- **Log Analysis**: Use the Security Dashboard for basic log analysis.
- **External Tools**: Configure external logging tools for advanced analysis.

## Conclusion
Following these security best practices will help maintain the security posture of the application and protect against common threats. Regular review and updates to security practices are essential as new threats emerge and technology evolves.
