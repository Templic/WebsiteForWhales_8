# Security Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides security best practices for developers, administrators, and users of the Cosmic Community Connect application. Following these practices helps maintain the security posture of the application and protects user data.

## For Developers

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Use the provided authentication middleware for all protected routes
- Never bypass authorization checks
- Always verify user permissions before performing sensitive operations
- Do not hardcode credentials or API keys in the source code

#### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs server-side using provided validation utilities
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Validate file uploads for type, size, and content
- Do not trust client-side validation alone

#### Output Handling
- Use the appropriate context-specific encoding for outputs
- Let React handle HTML rendering to prevent XSS
- For dynamic rendering, use DOMPurify with appropriate configuration
- Set proper Content-Type headers for all responses

#### Error Handling
- Use the centralized error handling middleware
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log errors appropriately but sanitize sensitive data
- Provide generic error messages to users

#### Dependency Management
- Only use approved dependencies from the project's package.json
- Do not add new dependencies without security review
- Run `node scripts/update-dependencies.js` regularly
- Report any vulnerabilities in dependencies to the security team

### Secure Development Workflow

#### Code Reviews
- All security-related code must undergo peer review
- Use the security checklist for reviewing security-critical components
- Look for common vulnerabilities like OWASP Top 10
- Verify that security controls are not bypassed

#### Security Testing
- Run security linters before committing code
- Add security test cases for new features
- Verify that authentication and authorization work correctly
- Test for edge cases that might bypass security controls

#### Version Control
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Review git history to ensure no secrets were accidentally committed
- Use signed commits for important security changes

#### Documentation
- Document security-related code with clear comments
- Update security documentation when changing security controls
- Document security assumptions and constraints
- Keep security architecture diagrams up-to-date

## For Administrators

### System Security

#### Server Configuration
- Follow the hardening guidelines in the deployment documentation
- Keep the system updated with security patches
- Use the provided security scripts for monitoring
- Implement network-level security controls

#### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for database access
- Implement network restrictions for database access
- Regularly backup the database using the provided scripts
- Monitor database access for unusual patterns

#### User Management
- Practice principle of least privilege for admin accounts
- Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
- Rotate admin credentials regularly
- Immediately revoke access for departing personnel

#### Monitoring & Logging
- Review security logs regularly
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- Investigate security incidents promptly

### Security Operations

#### Incident Response
- Follow the incident response plan when security events occur
- Document all security incidents and their resolution
- Perform post-incident analysis to prevent recurrence
- Update security controls based on incident learnings

#### Backup & Recovery
- Verify backups regularly using the provided scripts
- Test the recovery process periodically
- Store backups securely with encryption
- Document the backup and recovery procedures

#### Security Updates
- Apply security patches promptly
- Test security updates in staging before production
- Maintain a security update log
- Subscribe to security advisories for used components

#### Security Assessments
- Conduct regular security assessments
- Address findings based on risk prioritization
- Update security documentation after assessments
- Track security improvement metrics

## For Users

### Account Security

#### Password Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication when available
- Do not share account credentials
- Change passwords immediately if compromise is suspected

#### Session Security
- Log out from shared devices
- Do not leave sessions unattended
- Verify the connection is secure (HTTPS) before logging in
- Beware of phishing attempts

#### Data Protection
- Only upload content you have the right to share
- Be cautious about sharing sensitive information
- Review privacy settings regularly
- Understand what data is publicly visible

#### Security Awareness
- Be aware of common security threats
- Report suspicious activities to administrators
- Keep devices and browsers updated
- Verify emails claiming to be from the application
