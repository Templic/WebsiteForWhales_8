- Customized CSP for application requirements
- Added HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options headers
- Configured referrer policy

**Verification**:
- Verified headers using browser inspector
- Used online security header checking tools
- Confirmed proper configuration in production environment

### 4. Exposed Environment Variables
**Status**: Remediated

**Actions Taken**:
- Moved all sensitive configuration to secure environment variables
- Implemented environment variable validation
- Removed any hardcoded credentials
- Created separate development and production configurations

**Verification**:
- Code review to ensure no hardcoded secrets
- Verified proper loading of environment variables
- Tested configuration validation

## Low Severity Vulnerabilities

### 1. Outdated Dependencies
**Status**: Remediated

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated all dependencies to latest secure versions
- Implemented dependency scanning in CI/CD
- Created process for regular dependency updates
- Added vulnerability monitoring for dependencies

**Verification**:
- Verified no known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Tested application functionality after updates
- Confirmed monitoring tools are operational

### 2. Lack of Rate Limiting
**Status**: Remediated

**Actions Taken**:
- Implemented IP-based rate limiting
- Added specific rate limits for sensitive operations
- Created custom rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Added monitoring for rate limit violations

**Verification**:
- Tested rate limiting by exceeding threshold
- Verified proper blocking of excessive requests
- Confirmed logging of rate limit violations

### 3. Missing Error Handling
**Status**: Remediated

**Actions Taken**:
- Implemented global error handler
- Added custom error pages
- Prevented exposure of sensitive information in errors
- Added proper logging for all errors

**Verification**:
- Tested error handling with various error conditions
- Verified proper user-facing error messages
- Confirmed detailed logging of errors for debugging

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Reviews
- Scheduled quarterly security scans
- Annual comprehensive security audit
- Ongoing dependency vulnerability monitoring

### Security Response Process
- Established procedure for handling security incidents
- Created vulnerability disclosure policy
- Designated security contacts and responsibilities

### Security Training
- Documentation of security best practices
- Regular security awareness training for team members
- Code review guidelines with security focus

## Conclusion
The identified vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated through a comprehensive approach to security enhancement. The implementation of a robust backup and recovery system provides additional protection against data loss and ensures business continuity. Ongoing security maintenance procedures have been established to maintain the application's security posture over time.
