- Added monitoring for authentication failures
- Created alerting for suspicious activities

#### Status
✅ Implemented

### 9. File Upload Vulnerabilities

#### Issues
- Insecure file upload handling
- Missing file type validation

#### Remediation
- Implemented secure file upload handling
- Added ClamAV virus scanning for uploaded files
- Restricted file types and sizes

#### Status
✅ Implemented

### 10. API Security Vulnerabilities

#### Issues
- Insecure API endpoints
- Lack of rate limiting

#### Remediation
- Implemented API authentication for all endpoints
- Added rate limiting for API requests
- Implemented proper error handling to prevent information leakage

#### Status
✅ Implemented

## Vulnerability Assessment Process

1. **Identification**
   - Automated scanning with security tools
   - Manual code reviews
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Bug bounty program

2. **Assessment**
   - Severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Exploitability assessment
   - Potential impact analysis
   - Required effort estimation

3. **Remediation**
   - Assignment to responsible team/individual
   - Development of fix
   - Testing of fix
   - Deployment to production

4. **Verification**
   - Re-testing to verify fix
   - Security review of fix
   - Documentation update

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

- Weekly dependency updates using automated scripts
- Monthly security scans of the codebase
- Quarterly comprehensive security review
- Annual penetration testing

## Recent Vulnerability Fixes

### April 2025

1. **Memory Management Issue in File Upload Handler**
   - Severity: Medium
   - Description: Potential memory leak when handling large file uploads
   - Fix: Implemented streaming file processing and improved memory management
   - Verification: Load testing with multiple concurrent large file uploads

2. **JWT Token Validation Issue**
   - Severity: High
   - Description: Insufficient validation of JWT token signature
   - Fix: Enhanced validation logic and implemented token rotation
   - Verification: Penetration testing of authentication system

3. **Content Security Policy Configuration**
   - Severity: Medium
   - Description: Overly permissive CSP allowing inline scripts
   - Fix: Tightened CSP configuration and removed inline scripts
   - Verification: CSP analyzer tool and manual testing

## Security Improvement Roadmap

### Q2 2025
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Enhance API security with OAuth 2.0
- Improve security monitoring and alerting

### Q3 2025
- Conduct external penetration testing
- Implement security requirements for third-party integrations
- Enhance database security controls

### Q4 2025
- Implement advanced anomaly detection
- Enhance data loss prevention measures
- Conduct comprehensive security training for all developers

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

The project maintains a responsible disclosure policy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities:

1. Report vulnerabilities to security@example.com
2. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for assessment and remediation
4. Public disclosure coordinated with the security team

## Contact

For security-related inquiries or to report vulnerabilities, contact the security team at security@example.com.
