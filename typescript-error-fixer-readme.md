# TypeScript Error Fixer

A comprehensive solution for automatically detecting and fixing common TypeScript errors in full-stack applications.

## Overview

This project provides a set of specialized scripts for identifying and resolving TypeScript errors that frequently occur in complex JavaScript/TypeScript applications. The tools focus on maintainability, robustness, and adherence to industry best practices.

## Key Features

- **Automated Error Detection**: Identifies common TypeScript errors across the entire codebase
- **Pattern-Based Fixes**: Applies targeted fixes based on known error patterns
- **Backup Protection**: Creates backups of all modified files to prevent data loss
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of all changes for auditing
- **Missing Module Creation**: Generates missing utility and UI components
- **Performance Optimization**: Processes files in batches to maintain performance

## Scripts

### Main Scripts

1. **ts-error-fixer-comprehensive.js**: The primary script that combines all fixes in one solution
2. **fix-all-typescript-errors.js**: An early version that focuses on simple syntax errors
3. **ts-error-fixer-advanced.js**: An enhanced version with more sophisticated error detection

### Specialized Scripts

- **fix-catch-clause-errors.js**: Fixes `catch` clauses that use `Error` type instead of `unknown`
- **fix-duplicate-react-imports.js**: Resolves duplicate React import statements
- **fix-geometry-component-errors.js**: Fixes errors in geometry-related components
- **fix-lib-utils-imports.js**: Resolves issues with the `@/lib/utils` module imports
- **fix-module-import-errors.js**: Creates missing modules and fixes import paths
- **fix-path-aliases.js**: Updates TypeScript configuration for proper path alias handling
- **fix-react-import-errors.js**: Adds proper React import statements where missing
- **fix-sacred-geometry-components.js**: Fixes specialized components related to sacred geometry
- **fix-server-errors.js**: Fixes critical TypeScript errors in server-side code
- **fix-string-to-number-conversions.js**: Converts string values to numbers where needed
- **fix-three-fiber-errors.js**: Resolves errors specific to Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **fix-type-annotations.js**: Fixes malformed type annotations across the codebase

## Common Error Patterns Fixed

1. **Malformed type annotations with `$2`**: Unexpected `$2` characters in parameter types
2. **Duplicate React imports**: Multiple import statements importing React in the same file
3. **String-to-number conversions**: String literals used where numeric values are expected
4. **Catch clauses with improper types**: `catch` clauses using `Error` type instead of `unknown`
5. **Missing modules**: References to modules that don't exist in the codebase
6. **Path alias issues**: Incorrect imports using path aliases like `@/lib/utils`
7. **Duplicate identifier declarations**: Multiple declarations of the same identifier
8. **Corrupted import statements**: Malformed import syntax like `nimport`

## Usage

1. Run the comprehensive error fixer:
   ```
   node ts-error-fixer-comprehensive.js
   ```

2. For targeted fixes, run specialized scripts:
   ```
   node fix-duplicate-react-imports.js
   node fix-string-to-number-conversions.js
   ```

3. Review the log file (`typescript-error-fixes.log`) for a detailed summary of changes

## Implementation Details

### Backup System

All files are backed up before modification in the `./ts-fixes-backup` directory. This allows for easy recovery in case of unexpected issues.

### Pattern Recognition

Error patterns are defined as regular expressions with corresponding replacement functions. This approach makes it easy to add new error patterns over time.

### Missing Module Creation

The scripts automatically create commonly referenced modules that don't exist:
- `@/lib/utils`: A utility module with common functions like `cn` for class name merging
- `@/lib/memory-leak-detector`: A module for detecting memory leaks in React components
- UI components: Common UI components like buttons, labels, switches, etc.

### Batch Processing

Files are processed in batches to avoid memory issues when dealing with large codebases.

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with informative error messages
2. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit and debugging purposes
3. **Backups**: Automatic backup of all modified files
4. **Performance**: Batch processing for large codebases
5. **Idempotence**: Scripts can be run multiple times without causing harm
6. **Modularity**: Separate scripts for different error patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Interactive Mode**: Add an interactive mode for user confirmation of changes
2. **Error Reporter**: Generate detailed reports of errors and fixes
3. **Test Coverage**: Add test coverage for error patterns and fixes
4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Run automatically as part of continuous integration
