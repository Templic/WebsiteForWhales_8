## Three-Phase Approach

The TypeScript Intelligent Error Fixer implements a three-phase approach to error management:

### 1. Detection Phase

- Scans the codebase using the TypeScript Compiler API
- Categorizes and prioritizes errors by severity and impact
- Builds a comprehensive error map with detailed context
- Identifies error dependencies and potential root causes

### 2. Intelligent Analysis Phase

- Performs deep analysis to understand error relationships
- Detects common patterns and error clusters
- Uses AI to provide enhanced context and root cause analysis
- Generates optimal fix strategies with confidence scores

### 3. Prevention Phase

- Applies targeted fixes to resolve errors efficiently
- Prioritizes root cause errors to minimize cascading effects
- Implements fixes in batch or individual modes as appropriate
- Verifies fixes to ensure they don't introduce new issues

## Command-line Interface

The tool provides a comprehensive command-line interface with several commands:

- `analyze` - Analyze TypeScript errors without fixing them
- `fix` - Automatically fix TypeScript errors
- `patterns` - Find common error patterns in TypeScript code
- `verify` - Verify that TypeScript errors were fixed correctly
- `stats` - Show statistics about TypeScript errors and fixes
- `fix-file` - Fix TypeScript errors in a specific file

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze TypeScript errors
./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze

# Fix errors automatically
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix

# Find common error patterns
./analyze-ts-errors.sh patterns

# Fix errors in a specific file
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix-file src/components/Button.tsx
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Perform deep analysis with dependency tracking
./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze --deep

# Use OpenAI to enhance analysis
./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze --ai

# Show what would be fixed without making changes

# Fix only specific error categories
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --categories type_mismatch,missing_type

# Fix errors with backup creation
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --backup ./backups
```

## Error Categories

The tool categorizes TypeScript errors into the following types:

- `type_mismatch` - Type compatibility issues (e.g., "Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y'")
- `missing_type` - Missing type annotations (e.g., "Parameter implicitly has an 'any' type")
- `import_error` - Issues with imports (e.g., "Cannot find module 'X'")
- `null_reference` - Null/undefined safety issues (e.g., "Object is possibly 'null'")
- `interface_mismatch` - Interface implementation issues (e.g., "Class 'X' incorrectly implements interface 'Y'")
- `generic_constraint` - Issues with generic constraints (e.g., "Type 'X' does not satisfy the constraint 'Y'")
- `declaration_error` - Issues with declarations (e.g., "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'X'")
- `syntax_error` - Syntax and grammar issues (e.g., "';' expected")
- `other` - Other error types not fitting the above categories

## Severity Levels

Errors are assigned a severity level based on their potential impact:

- `critical` - Prevents compilation or would cause runtime crashes
- `high` - Likely to cause runtime issues or unexpected behavior
- `medium` - Might cause issues in some scenarios
- `low` - Style issues or minor improvements (e.g., implicit 'any' types)

## Configuration Options

The tool provides a wide range of configuration options:

### Analysis Options
- `deep` - Perform deep analysis with dependency tracking
- `useAI` - Use OpenAI to enhance analysis with advanced insights
- `categories` - Filter analysis to specific error categories
- `exclude` - Exclude files or directories from analysis
- `saveToDb` - Save analysis results to the database

### Fix Options
- `createBackups` - Create backups of files before modifying them
- `backupDir` - Directory for file backups
- `maxErrorsPerFile` - Maximum number of errors to fix per file
- `dryRun` - Show what would be fixed without making changes
- `generateTypeDefinitions` - Generate missing type definitions
- `fixMissingInterfaces` - Fix missing interface implementations
- `fixImplicitAny` - Fix implicit 'any' types with explicit types
- `fixDependencies` - Fix errors with dependency awareness
- `batchFix` - Apply fixes in batch mode when possible

## AI-Powered Analysis

When OpenAI integration is enabled, the tool can leverage AI capabilities for enhanced error analysis and fixing:

### Error Analysis with AI
- Provides root cause analysis with natural language explanations
- Offers high-quality fix suggestions with contextual awareness
- Identifies related errors that might be caused by the same issue
- Explains the reasoning behind suggested fixes

### Error Pattern Analysis with AI
- Enhances pattern descriptions with detailed explanations
- Improves suggested fixes with comprehensive solutions
- Provides general approaches to avoid similar errors
- Gives concrete examples of fixes for specific error instances

### Setting Up OpenAI Integration

1. Get an API key from OpenAI
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Use the `--ai` flag with analyze or fix commands:
   ```
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze --ai
   ```

## Database Integration

The tool integrates with a PostgreSQL database to store error data, patterns, fixes, and analytics.

### Database Schema

- `typescript_errors` - Stores individual TypeScript errors
- `error_patterns` - Stores common error patterns
- `error_fixes` - Stores fix history and details
- `error_analysis` - Stores analysis data for errors
- `scan_results` - Stores scan results and statistics

### Setting Up Database

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
2. Set up the database connection in the environment:
   ```
   export DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/ts_errors
   ```
3. Push the schema to the database:
   ```
   npm run db:push
   ```

## Batch Fixing

The tool supports two approaches to fixing errors:

### Batch Mode
- Processes multiple errors in a single operation
- Applies fixes to related errors together
- More efficient but may be less precise for complex fixes

### Individual Mode
- Fixes errors one by one with targeted changes
- Provides maximum precision for complex fixes
- Slower but more reliable for challenging scenarios

To control the fixing mode:

```bash
# Enable batch fixing (default)
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --batch

# Disable batch fixing
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --no-batch
```

## Advanced Usage

### Handling Complex Projects

For large or complex projects, consider these approaches:

1. **Phased Fixing**:
   ```bash
   # First, fix critical errors only
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --categories syntax_error,import_error
   
   # Then, fix type and null reference errors
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --categories type_mismatch,null_reference
   
   # Finally, fix low-priority errors
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --categories missing_type
   ```

2. **Targeted Fixing**:
   ```bash
   # First, analyze to identify problematic files
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze --deep
   
   # Then, fix specific files or directories
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix-file src/components/
   ```

3. **Dependency-Aware Fixing**:
   ```bash
   # Use dependency tracking to fix root causes first
   ./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --deep-fix
   ```

### Customizing Fix Behavior

Control specific fixing behaviors with these flags:

```bash
# Disable automatic type generation
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --no-interfaces

# Disable implicit any fixing
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --no-any

# Disable missing property fixing
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --no-props
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Tool doesn't find any errors**: Ensure the tsconfig.json path is correct
- **OpenAI integration not working**: Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is set correctly
- **Fixes causing more errors**: Try disabling batch fixing with `--no-batch`
- **Database connection failing**: Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

### Getting Help

Run commands with the `--help` flag to see detailed options:

```bash
./analyze-ts-errors.sh analyze --help
./analyze-ts-errors.sh fix --help
```
