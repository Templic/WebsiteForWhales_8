## üõ°Ô∏è **Security System Integration**

### **Aligned with 6-Layer Security Workflow:**
```
Authentication ‚Üí Rate Limiting ‚Üí CSRF ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí AI Validation ‚Üí Content Check
```

**Service Integration:**
- **IAuthenticationService** integrates with Layer 1 (Authentication) 
- **IContentService** integrates with Layer 6 (Content Check)
- **IConsciousnessService** integrates with Layer 5 (AI Validation for consciousness data)
- **ISystemService** monitors all layers with analytics and logging

**PostgreSQL Session Security:**
- Maintained existing enterprise-grade session architecture
- Enhanced with consciousness profile data storage
- Preserved OAuth multi-domain functionality
- Added consciousness activity tracking
