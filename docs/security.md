# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in our application, focusing on API security, SQL injection prevention, and rate limiting.

## API Security Framework

The API security framework consists of several layers of protection:

### 1. Input Validation

All API requests are validated using Zod schemas to ensure:
- Required fields are present
- Data types are correct
- Values are within acceptable ranges
- String patterns match expected formats

Implementation files:
- `server/middleware/validation.ts` - Core validation middleware
- `server/middleware/apiSecurity.ts` - API-specific validation

### 2. Rate Limiting

Multiple tiers of rate limiting are implemented based on endpoint sensitivity and user roles:

| Rate Limiter | Use Case | Default Limit | Window |
|--------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| `authRateLimit` | Authentication endpoints | 30 requests | 15 minutes |
| `sensitiveOpRateLimit` | Password reset, 2FA | 5 requests | 1 hour |
| `publicApiRateLimit` | Public endpoints | 100 requests | 15 minutes |
| `protectedApiRateLimit` | Authenticated endpoints | 100-500 requests (role-based) | 15 minutes |
| `securityLimiter` | Security operations | 20-100 requests (role-based) | 10 minutes |

Implementation files:
- `server/middleware/rateLimit.ts` - Rate limiting middleware

### 3. Authentication

JWT-based authentication with:
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation capabilities
- Secure token generation and validation

Implementation files:
- `server/security/jwt.ts` - JWT token handling
- `server/middleware/jwtAuth.ts` - JWT authentication middleware
- `server/middleware/apiSecurity.ts` - Advanced JWT verification

### 4. Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) with:
- Fine-grained permission checks
- Role verification on protected endpoints
- Security logging for authorization failures

Implementation files:
- `server/middleware/apiSecurity.ts` - Role-based authorization
- `server/routes/secureApiRoutes.ts` - Route protection

### 5. SQL Injection Prevention

All database interactions are protected against SQL injection through:
- Parameterized queries using Drizzle ORM
- Avoidance of raw SQL
- Input validation before database operations

Implementation files:
- `server/security/databaseSecurity.ts` - Database security utilities

### 6. Security Logging

Comprehensive security logging for:
- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Authorization failures
- Rate limit violations
- Input validation failures
- Security configuration changes

Implementation files:
- `server/security/security.ts` - Security logging utilities

## Security Scan

Regular security scans run every 60 minutes in MAXIMUM security mode to detect:
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Insecure code patterns
- API security issues
- Configuration weaknesses

Implementation files:
- `server/security/maximumSecurityScan.ts` - Security scanning implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Fail securely** - All error cases default to secure outcomes
2. **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least privilege** - Users only have minimum necessary permissions
4. **Secure defaults** - All security features enabled by default
5. **Never trust user input** - All input validated before processing

## Maintenance and Updates

Security controls should be regularly reviewed and updated based on:
- Security scan findings
- New threat intelligence
- Application changes
- Industry best practices

## Implementing New Endpoints

When adding new API endpoints, follow these security guidelines:

1. Create a Zod schema for input validation
2. Apply appropriate rate limiting middleware
3. Add authentication requirements for protected endpoints
4. Implement authorization checks based on required roles
5. Use ORM methods for database operations (never raw SQL)
6. Add appropriate security logging
