# Documentation Updates Guide

This guide outlines best practices for maintaining and updating documentation in the project.

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation is organized in the following locations:

- `/docs/` - General documentation and guides
- `/reports/` - Security reports and audits
- `/scripts/README.md` - Documentation for utility scripts

## Documentation Files

Important documentation files include:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/reports/vulnerability_remediation_plan.md` | Details on vulnerability fixes and remediation |
| `/reports/security_implementation_report.md` | Overview of security features implemented |
| `/reports/security_best_practices_guide.md` | Guide for security best practices |
| `/reports/security_audit_compliance.md` | Compliance status with security audit |
| `/docs/backup_restore_guide.md` | Guide for backup and restore procedures |
| `/docs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md` | Guide for dependency management |

## Documentation Update Process

### When to Update Documentation

Documentation should be updated in the following situations:

1. When new features are added to the application
2. When existing features are modified
3. When security vulnerabilities are fixed
4. When dependency versions change significantly
5. When new processes or workflows are implemented
6. When issues are discovered in existing documentation

### How to Update Documentation

Follow these steps when updating documentation:

1. **Identify relevant documents** - Determine which documentation files need to be updated
2. **Review current content** - Understand the existing documentation before making changes
3. **Make targeted updates** - Focus on specific sections that need updating
4. **Maintain formatting** - Keep consistent with the existing format and style
5. **Update timestamps** - Add or update the last-modified date at the bottom of the document
6. **Cross-reference** - Update related documents if necessary

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be concise** - Use clear, straightforward language
2. **Use examples** - Include practical examples where helpful
3. **Include code snippets** - Provide relevant code examples
4. **Maintain structure** - Follow the existing document structure
5. **Use proper formatting** - Use Markdown formatting consistently
6. **Check links** - Ensure all links to other documents or external resources work
7. **Version information** - Include version information where relevant

## Security Documentation

When updating security-related documentation:

1. **Never include sensitive information** - Keep secrets, keys, and internal vulnerabilities private
2. **Be specific about fixes** - Detail what was fixed without revealing exploitable information
3. **Include verification steps** - Document how fixes were verified
4. **Reference standards** - Reference relevant security standards or best practices
5. **Update compliance status** - Update compliance documents if security status changes

## Documentation Review

Before finalizing documentation updates:

1. **Technical accuracy** - Ensure all technical information is correct
2. **Completeness** - Check that all necessary information is included
3. **Clarity** - Verify that the documentation is understandable
4. **Consistency** - Check for consistency with other documentation
5. **Formatting** - Verify proper Markdown formatting

## Documentation Templates

For new documentation files, consider following this basic structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview
Brief description of the topic.

## Key Sections
Main content organized into sections.

### Sub-sections
Detailed information with examples.

## Examples
Code examples or usage examples.

## Related Documentation
Links to related documentation.

*Last updated: [Date]*
```

## Automated Documentation Updates

When security scanners, dependency updaters, or other automated tools run, ensure the relevant documentation is updated to reflect:

1. When the last scan was performed
2. What issues were identified
3. What remediation steps were taken
4. Current security posture

This can be done manually or through automated scripts that update documentation files with the latest information.
