# Backup and Restore Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the backup and restore procedures for the Cosmic Community Connect application. It provides detailed instructions for performing backups, verifying their integrity, and restoring data in case of data loss or system failure.

## Backup Strategy

The application implements a comprehensive backup strategy with multiple layers:

### Types of Backups

1. **Database Backups**
   - Complete PostgreSQL database dumps
   - Incremental transaction log backups
   - Schema-only backups for development environments

2. **File Backups**
   - User-uploaded content (images, audio, documents)
   - Configuration files
   - Log files (for audit and compliance purposes)

3. **Application Code Backups**
   - Git repository backup
   - Deployment configuration backup
   - Environment variables backup (encrypted)

### Backup Schedule

| Backup Type | Frequency | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Full Database | Daily | 30 days | Primary + Secondary |
| Transaction Logs | Hourly | 7 days | Primary + Secondary |
| User Uploads | Daily | 90 days | Primary + Secondary |
| Configuration | On change | 90 days | Primary + Secondary |
| Application Code | On release | Indefinite | Git + Secondary |

### Backup Storage

- **Primary Storage**: Cloud storage with encryption
- **Secondary Storage**: Offsite backup for disaster recovery
- **Development Backups**: Local encrypted storage for development environments

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backup

#### Automated Daily Backup

The system performs automated daily backups of the PostgreSQL database:

1. Database dump is created using pg_dump
2. Dump file is compressed and encrypted
3. Backup file is uploaded to secure cloud storage
4. Backup verification is performed
5. Older backups are pruned according to retention policy

To manually initiate a database backup:

```bash
# Run the database backup script
./scripts/backup.sh database
```

#### Special Considerations for Neon Serverless PostgreSQL

For Neon serverless PostgreSQL databases:

1. Utilize Neon's built-in point-in-time recovery feature
2. Perform logical backups using the pg_dump utility with the provided connection string
3. Schedule backups during off-peak hours to minimize impact
4. Test restoration regularly to ensure compatibility

### File Backup

User-uploaded files are backed up daily:

1. Files are packaged with directory structure preserved
2. Archive is compressed and encrypted
3. Archive is uploaded to secure cloud storage
4. Verification is performed to ensure integrity

To manually initiate a file backup:

```bash
# Run the file backup script
./scripts/backup.sh files
```

### Configuration Backup

Configuration files are backed up whenever changes are made:

1. Configuration files are collected and versioned
2. Sensitive information is encrypted
3. Configuration archive is stored securely
4. Previous versions are maintained for rollback capability

To manually backup configuration:

```bash
# Run the configuration backup script
./scripts/backup.sh config
```

## Verification Procedures

### Backup Verification

All backups are automatically verified after creation:

1. Database backups are verified by restoring to a test instance
2. File backups are verified by checksum validation
3. Configuration backups are verified by syntax checking

To manually verify a backup:

```bash
# Verify the latest backup
./scripts/verify-backup.sh latest

# Verify a specific backup by date
./scripts/verify-backup.sh 2025-04-06
```

### Scheduled Verification

In addition to post-backup verification:

1. Weekly verification of random previous backups
2. Monthly restoration test to verify complete recovery process
3. Quarterly disaster recovery simulation

## Restore Procedures

### Database Restoration

To restore the database from a backup:

1. Identify the appropriate backup file to restore from
2. Stop the application services
3. Create a backup of the current database (if accessible)
4. Restore the database from the selected backup
5. Verify database integrity
6. Restart application services

```bash
# Restore database from the latest backup
./scripts/restore.sh database latest

# Restore database from a specific backup
./scripts/restore.sh database 2025-04-06
```

### File Restoration

To restore user files from a backup:

1. Identify the appropriate backup archive
2. Create a backup of current files (if available)
3. Extract and decrypt the backup archive
4. Replace the current files with restored files
5. Verify file integrity and permissions
6. Restart application services if needed

```bash
# Restore files from the latest backup
./scripts/restore.sh files latest

# Restore files from a specific backup
./scripts/restore.sh files 2025-04-06
```

### Configuration Restoration

To restore configuration files:

1. Identify the appropriate configuration backup
2. Create a backup of current configuration
3. Extract and decrypt the configuration archive
4. Replace current configuration with restored files
5. Verify configuration syntax
6. Restart application services

```bash
# Restore configuration from the latest backup
./scripts/restore.sh config latest

# Restore configuration from a specific backup
./scripts/restore.sh config 2025-04-06
```

### Full System Restoration

For complete system restoration:

1. Provision new infrastructure if needed
2. Restore application code from repository
3. Restore configuration files
4. Restore database
5. Restore user files
6. Verify system integrity
7. Perform application testing
8. Switch traffic to restored system

```bash
# Perform a complete system restoration
./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh
```

## Backup Security

### Encryption

All backups are encrypted:

1. Database dumps are encrypted with AES-256
2. File backups are encrypted with AES-256
3. Configuration backups with sensitive data are encrypted
4. Encryption keys are managed securely and backed up separately

### Access Controls

Access to backups is strictly controlled:

1. Backup access requires multi-factor authentication
2. All backup access is logged and audited
3. Backup operations follow principle of least privilege
4. Separate credentials are used for backup operations

## Testing and Monitoring

### Backup Monitoring

The backup system is continuously monitored:

1. Alerts for backup failures
2. Monitoring of backup storage capacity
3. Verification of backup completion
4. Regular audit of backup access

### Restoration Testing

Regular testing of restoration procedures:

1. Monthly restoration test to a test environment
2. Quarterly full disaster recovery simulation
3. Documentation of test results and improvements

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Target recovery times for different scenarios:

1. Single file restoration: < 1 hour
2. Database restoration: < 4 hours
3. Complete system restoration: < 24 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

Maximum acceptable data loss:

1. Database data: < 1 hour
2. User-uploaded files: < 24 hours
3. Configuration changes: < 1 hour

### Disaster Recovery Plan

Comprehensive disaster recovery plan:

1. Emergency contact information
2. Step-by-step recovery procedures
3. Role assignments for recovery team
4. Communication plan for stakeholders

## Compliance and Retention

### Data Retention

Backup retention policies:

1. Daily backups retained for 30 days
2. Weekly backups retained for 90 days
3. Monthly backups retained for 1 year
4. Annual backups retained for 7 years

### Compliance Requirements

Backup and restore procedures comply with:

1. Data protection regulations
2. Industry-specific requirements
3. Contractual obligations
4. Internal security policies
