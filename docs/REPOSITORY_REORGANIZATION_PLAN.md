# Repository Reorganization Plan

This document outlines the ongoing reorganization of the repository structure and component organization to improve maintainability and developer experience.

## Current Status

The repository is currently in a transition phase with the following characteristics:

1. Feature-specific components are being migrated to dedicated feature directories
2. Deprecated components are being marked but not yet removed
3. Documentation is being updated to reflect the new structure
4. Cross-component dependencies are being identified for refactoring

## Goals

The reorganization aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Improved Organization**: Logical grouping of related components and features
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidation of similar components
3. **Clear Documentation**: Proper documentation of component purposes and usage
4. **Maintainable Structure**: Structure that supports future growth
5. **Migration Path**: Clear path for migrating from deprecated components

## Reorganization Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation (Current)

1. ✅ Document existing repository structure
2. ✅ Update component READMEs
3. ✅ Document deprecated components
4. ✅ Document active routing paths

### Phase 2: Component Analysis

1. ✅ Run component analysis scripts
2. ✅ Identify similar components for consolidation
3. ✅ Create consolidation plan
4. ⏳ Determine migration paths for existing references

### Phase 3: Component Migration

1. ⏳ Move components to appropriate feature directories
2. ⏳ Update import paths in existing code
3. ⏳ Add deprecation notices to old components
4. ⏳ Create new documentation for migrated components

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Finalization

1. ⏳ Remove duplicated components
2. ⏳ Set timeline for deprecated component removal
3. ⏳ Update build configuration
4. ⏳ Finalize documentation

## Component Organization Pattern

Each feature directory follows this pattern:

```
features/
└── feature-name/
    ├── index.ts                 # Exports all components
    ├── README.md                # Feature documentation
    ├── ComponentName.tsx        # Individual components
    ├── ComponentName.test.tsx   # Component tests
    ├── ComponentName.module.css # Component styles (if not using Tailwind)
    └── types.ts                 # Feature-specific types
```

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating components:

1. Use the component migration script:
   ```
   node scripts/component-migration.js --source path/to/old/component.tsx --destination features/feature-name/ComponentName.tsx
   ```

2. Update import paths in all files that reference the component:
   ```diff
   - import { Component } from '../old/path';
   + import { Component } from '@/components/features/feature-name';
   ```

3. Add deprecation notices to the original component:
   ```tsx
   /**
    * @deprecated This component has been moved to @/components/features/feature-name
    * Please update your imports to use the new location.
    */
   ```

## Dependencies Between Components

The consolidation plan identifies the following key dependencies:

1. Music components depend on audio components
2. Shop components depend on common UI components
3. Experience components depend on cosmic and immersive components

These dependencies guide the reorganization order to minimize disruption.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: April 2025 (Current)
- **Phase 2**: April-May 2025
- **Phase 3**: May-June 2025
- **Phase 4**: June-July 2025

## Conclusion

This reorganization plan provides a structured approach to improving the repository organization while minimizing disruption to ongoing development. By following this plan, the repository will evolve into a more maintainable and developer-friendly structure.
