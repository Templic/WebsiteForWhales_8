# Repository Reorganization Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for reorganizing the repository structure to improve maintainability, address conflicts between component versions, and efficiently manage imported components from various sources.

## Current Status

The repository is currently in a transition phase with the following characteristics:

1. Feature-specific components are being migrated to dedicated feature directories
2. Deprecated components are being marked but not yet removed
3. Documentation is being updated to reflect the new structure
4. Cross-component dependencies are being identified for refactoring

## Goals

The reorganization aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Improved Organization**: Logical grouping of related components and features
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidation of similar components
3. **Clear Documentation**: Proper documentation of component purposes and usage
4. **Maintainable Structure**: Structure that supports future growth
5. **Migration Path**: Clear path for migrating from deprecated components
6. **Component Attribution**: Clearly mark imported components with proper attribution
7. **Archive Management**: Properly categorize archived pages to prevent confusion

## New Directory Structure

## Reorganization Steps

### Phase 1: Documentation (Completed)

1. ✅ Document existing repository structure
2. ✅ Update component READMEs
3. ✅ Document deprecated components
4. ✅ Document active routing paths

### Phase 2: Component Analysis (Current)

1. ✅ Run component analysis scripts
2. ✅ Identify similar components for consolidation
3. ✅ Create consolidation plan
4. ⏳ Determine migration paths for existing references

### Phase 3: Component Migration (Upcoming)

1. ⏳ Move components to appropriate feature directories
2. ⏳ Update import paths in existing code
3. ⏳ Add deprecation notices to old components
4. ⏳ Create new documentation for migrated components

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Finalization (Future)

1. ⏳ Remove duplicated components
2. ⏳ Set timeline for deprecated component removal
3. ⏳ Update build configuration
4. ⏳ Finalize documentation

## Implementation Tools

We've created several scripts to automate this reorganization process:

1. `scripts/repository-reorganization.js` - Creates the new directory structure
2. `scripts/component-migration.js` - Migrates components to their new locations
3. `scripts/page-reorganization.js` - Reorganizes pages and marks archived pages
4. `scripts/update-imports.js` - Updates import paths throughout the codebase
5. `scripts/create-backup.js` - Creates a backup before making changes

## Component Organization Pattern

Each feature directory follows this pattern:

```
features/
└── feature-name/
    ├── index.ts                 # Exports all components
    ├── README.md                # Feature documentation
    ├── ComponentName.tsx        # Individual components
    ├── ComponentName.test.tsx   # Component tests
    ├── ComponentName.module.css # Component styles (if not using Tailwind)
    └── types.ts                 # Feature-specific types
```

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating components:

1. **Create a backup first**
   ```
   node scripts/create-backup.js
   ```
   This will create a backup in the `backups/` directory with a timestamp.

2. **Use the component migration script**:
   ```
   node scripts/component-migration.js --source path/to/old/component.tsx --destination features/feature-name/ComponentName.tsx
   ```

3. **Update import paths** in all files that reference the component:
   ```diff
   - import { Component } from '../old/path';
   + import { Component } from '@/components/features/feature-name';
   ```

4. **Add deprecation notices** to the original component:
   ```tsx
   /**
    * @deprecated This component has been moved to @/components/features/feature-name
    * Please update your imports to use the new location.
    */
   ```

## Component Migration Details

Components will be migrated based on their function:

- **Common Components**: General-purpose UI components like buttons, cards, etc.
- **Layout Components**: Components that define the overall structure like headers, footers, etc.
- **Feature Components**: Components specific to particular features of the application
- **Imported Components**: Components from external sources with clear attribution

Each migrated component will have a header comment added indicating:
- Its source
- When it was migrated
- Any special notes about compatibility

## Dependencies Between Components

The consolidation plan identifies the following key dependencies:

1. Music components depend on audio components
2. Shop components depend on common UI components
3. Experience components depend on cosmic and immersive components

These dependencies guide the reorganization order to minimize disruption.

## Page Reorganization Details

Pages will be organized by feature area. Archived pages will:
- Be moved to the `pages/archived/` directory
- Have a special header comment indicating they are archived
- Display a banner at the top when rendered to indicate they are archived
- Have their routes commented out in the routing configuration

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after reorganization:

1. You can restore from the backup created at the beginning
2. Or selectively copy files back from the backup as needed

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: April 2025 (Completed)
- **Phase 2**: April-May 2025 (Current)
- **Phase 3**: May-June 2025
- **Phase 4**: June-July 2025

## Future Maintenance

To maintain this organization going forward:

1. Keep components in their appropriate category directories
2. Mark deprecated components and pages clearly
3. Move truly obsolete code to the archived directories
4. Update this document as the organization evolves

## Conclusion

This reorganization plan provides a structured approach to improving the repository organization while minimizing disruption to ongoing development. By following this plan, the repository will evolve into a more maintainable and developer-friendly structure.
