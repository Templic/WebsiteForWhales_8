# YouTube Integration Method Update

## Overview
We have simplified our YouTube integration approach due to security system blocking complex embed methods.

## Previous Method (Complex Embed)
- Used advanced iframe embedding with multiple security parameters
- Attempted autoplay and complex YouTube Player API integration
- Often blocked by security layers causing black boxes

## Current Method (Simple API)
- **YouTube Data API v3** for video metadata (views, likes, duration, thumbnails)
- **Simple iframe embed** without autoplay to avoid security blocks
- **Play button positioned left** to not obscure album artwork
- **Authentic data display** from YouTube's official API

## Implementation Details

### API Integration
- Uses `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Fetches real video statistics from YouTube Data API
- Displays authentic view counts, like counts, and video duration

### Player Design
- Red play button positioned on left side of thumbnail
- Preserves album cover visibility
- Clean YouTube embed player loads when clicked
- No autoplay to prevent security blocking

### Security Compatibility
- Works within existing security framework
- No complex API calls that trigger security blocks
- Simple, reliable video playback

## Benefits
- ✅ Real video statistics (not placeholder data)
- ✅ Album artwork fully visible
- ✅ Compatible with security system
- ✅ Reliable video playback
- ✅ Fast loading times
- ✅ Authentic user experience
