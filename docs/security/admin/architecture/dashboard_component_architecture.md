# Security Dashboard Component Architecture

## Overview

The Security Dashboard provides administrators and security personnel with a comprehensive view of the system's security posture. It integrates quantum-resistant cryptography monitoring, key management, anomaly detection visualization, and security event monitoring into a unified interface.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each dashboard component should have a single responsibility
2. **Reactive Updates**: Components should automatically update in response to security state changes
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex functionality should be revealed progressively based on user needs
4. **Defensive Rendering**: Components should handle missing or malformed data gracefully
5. **Accessibility**: All components must be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
6. **Performance**: Dashboard should maintain 60fps even with high-volume security event streams

```

## Data Flow

1. **Security Event Flow**
   - Backend WebSocket emits security events
   - EventListener middleware processes and categorizes events
   - Events are dispatched to SecurityEvents state
   - UI components reactively update to display new events
   - Anomaly detection evaluates events for patterns
   - High-severity events trigger AlertIndicator notification

2. **Key Management Flow**
   - User initiates key operation through KeyOperationsPanel
   - Operation request is sent to UnifiedQuantumSecurity API
   - API response updates KeyManagement state
   - KeyInventoryList and KeyDetailView reflect updated state
   - Operation result is logged as SecurityEvent
   - Blockchain logging records immutable operation log

3. **Dashboard Customization Flow**
   - User modifies dashboard through DashboardCustomizationPanel
   - Changes update UserPreferences state
   - DashboardGrid reactively adjusts to new layout
   - Preferences are persisted to user profile
   - Layout changes are synchronized across devices

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - All dashboard access requires authentication
   - Component visibility is controlled by user permissions
   - Sensitive operations require additional confirmation
   - Session timeout monitoring with automatic logout

2. **Data Protection**
   - No sensitive cryptographic material displayed in clear text
   - Key material is masked with option to reveal temporarily
   - Clipboard operations for sensitive data are secured
   - Screen lock detection triggers automatic masking

3. **Audit & Compliance**
   - All user interactions with security features are logged
   - Audit trail for dashboard customization is maintained
   - Security event viewing is tracked for compliance
   - Administrative actions require justification notes

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Error Handling**
   - Components handle partial and failed data gracefully
   - Error boundaries prevent cascading UI failures
   - Connectivity issues show appropriate offline indicators
   - Recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Virtualization for long event and key lists
   - Pagination for large data sets
   - Throttling of high-volume event streams
   - Memoization of expensive calculations and renders

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation for all operations
   - Screen reader compatibility with ARIA attributes
   - Color contrast compliance for security indicators
   - Focus management for modal workflows

## Integration Points

1. **Backend API Integration**
   - RESTful API for data retrieval and operations
   - WebSocket for real-time event streaming
   - GraphQL for complex data requirements
   - Blockchain query interface for immutable logs

2. **Security Module Integration**
   - UnifiedQuantumSecurity for cryptographic operations
   - AnomalyDetection for security event analysis
   - ImmutableSecurityLogger for audit trail
   - SecurityEventTypes for event classification

## Next Steps

1. Implement core dashboard layout components
2. Create security event visualization system
3. Build key management interface components
4. Develop security metrics visualization
5. Implement dashboard customization system
