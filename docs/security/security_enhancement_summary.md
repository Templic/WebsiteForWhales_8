- Added technical usage examples with best practices

## Integration Improvements

The enhancements create a more cohesive security architecture by:

1. Ensuring consistent timestamp formats between:
   - Quantum-resistant cryptography operations
   - Blockchain security logging
   - Anomaly detection features

2. Improving type safety across module boundaries:
   - Consistent interface definitions
   - Proper TypeScript casting
   - Elimination of undefined/null edge cases

3. Standardizing error handling:
   - Consistent error logging format
   - Proper error propagation
   - Improved error context for debugging

## Blockchain Security Logging Integration

The security architecture now properly logs quantum cryptography operations to the immutable blockchain security log with:

- Consistent timestamp formats (numeric via Date.now())
- Standardized event types for cryptographic operations
- Proper error logging for failed cryptographic operations

## Anomaly Detection Integration

The machine learning-based anomaly detection now properly integrates with quantum cryptography through:

- Standardized feature extraction for cryptographic operations
- Common timestamp format for temporal analysis
- Consistent error reporting for anomaly detection

## Future Work

Refer to the detailed roadmap in `docs/security/next_gen_security_roadmap.md` for the planned future enhancements, including:

1. Zero-Knowledge Security Proofs
2. Homomorphic Encryption Bridge
3. Security Telemetry Correlation
4. Integrated Threat Intelligence
5. Component Versioning Validation

## Technical Guidelines

When working with the enhanced security components:

1. Always use numeric timestamps via Date.now()
2. Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
3. Use the provided type interfaces for compile-time safety
4. Reference the implementation guides for best practices

## Conclusion

These enhancements have significantly improved the robustness, type safety, and integration of our security architecture. The standardized approach to timestamps, error handling, and type safety ensures that all security components work together seamlessly, providing a strong foundation for future security enhancements.
