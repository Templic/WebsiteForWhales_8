## 🌊 **The Sophisticated Routing Algorithm**

```typescript
function determineOptimalAPI(task: ConsciousnessTask): 'taskade' | 'openai' {
  // Context Continuity Weight (40%)
  const contextWeight = task.requiresSessionContinuity ? 0.4 : 0;
  
  // Precision Requirements (30%)
  const precisionWeight = task.requiresAdvancedParameters ? 0.3 : 0;
  
  // Collaboration Needs (20%)
  const collaborationWeight = task.involvesTeamConsciousness ? 0.2 : 0;
  
  // Cost Optimization (10%)
  const costWeight = task.optimizeForCost ? 0.1 : 0;
  
  const taskadeScore = contextWeight + collaborationWeight + costWeight;
  const openaiScore = precisionWeight + (task.requiresFunctionCalling ? 0.2 : 0);
  
  // Consciousness factor: whale wisdom work benefits from Taskade's continuity
  if (task.whaleWisdomLevel > 90 && task.requiresSessionContinuity) {
    return 'taskade';
  }
  
  // Technical precision factor: complex calculations need OpenAI's capabilities
