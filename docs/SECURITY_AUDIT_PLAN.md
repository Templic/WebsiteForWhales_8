### 5.3 Manual Testing

- Code review by security experts
- Configuration review
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Business logic testing

## 6. Audit Frequency and Schedule

The security audit follows this schedule:

1. **Quick Security Scan**: Weekly
   - Automated scanning for critical vulnerabilities
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Basic configuration checks

2. **Full Security Scan**: Monthly
   - Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
   - Complete dependency analysis
   - Full configuration assessment
   - Secret and credential scanning

3. **Comprehensive Security Audit**: Quarterly
   - Full code review
   - Thorough vulnerability assessment
   - Compliance checks
   - Security control evaluation
   - Detailed reporting and recommendations

4. **Security Posture Review**: Annually
   - Review of overall security architecture
   - Assessment of security program effectiveness
   - Strategic security recommendations
   - Security roadmap planning

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles are involved in the security audit process:

1. **Security Lead**: Oversees the security audit process
2. **Developers**: Responsible for fixing identified vulnerabilities
3. **DevOps Engineers**: Address infrastructure and configuration issues
4. **Product Managers**: Prioritize security fixes in the development roadmap
5. **Security Auditors**: Conduct comprehensive security assessments and validations

## 8. Vulnerability Management

The vulnerability management process includes:

### 8.1 Vulnerability Tracking

- All vulnerabilities are documented in the issue tracking system
- Each vulnerability includes severity, description, and recommended fix
- Vulnerabilities are assigned to appropriate team members
- Fix progress is tracked and reported

### 8.2 Severity Classification

Vulnerabilities are classified using the following severity levels:

1. **Critical**: Immediate action required; potential for significant data breach or system compromise
2. **High**: Requires priority attention; potential for sensitive data exposure or significant security impact
3. **Medium**: Should be addressed in near term; impacts security but with limited exploitation potential
4. **Low**: Should be fixed as part of normal development; minimal direct security impact

### 8.3 Remediation Timeframes

Vulnerabilities should be remediated within these timeframes:

1. **Critical**: Within 1-2 days
2. **High**: Within 1 week
3. **Medium**: Within 1 month
4. **Low**: Within 3 months

## 9. Reporting

- Security header configurations
- Input validation rules
- CSRF protection mechanisms
- Content Security Policy templates

### 11.2 Proprietary/Closed Components
