# File Upload Security Implementation

This document describes the file upload security features implemented in the application to protect against common vulnerabilities and security risks.

## Overview

File uploads present significant security risks to web applications, including:

1. Path traversal attacks
2. Malicious file uploads 
3. Unrestricted content type execution
4. File size abuse
5. MIME type spoofing

Our implementation addresses these concerns through a comprehensive security approach.

## Security Features

### Content-Based File Type Validation

Unlike traditional implementations that rely solely on file extensions, our system validates files based on their actual content:

- Uses the `file-type` package to detect MIME types based on file content signatures
- Prevents attackers from disguising executable files as harmless content
- Ensures uploaded files contain valid data matching their claimed type

### Secure Filename Handling

The system implements multiple filename security measures:

- Generates random filenames to prevent predictable storage paths
- Removes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../` or `..\\`)
- Sanitizes filenames to remove special characters
- Validates extensions against allowed lists
- Prevents null byte injection attacks

### File Size Validation

To prevent denial-of-service attacks through oversized files:

- Enforces configurable file size limits (currently 50MB maximum)
- Returns clear error messages for oversized files
- Aborts large uploads early to conserve server resources

### MIME Type Verification

Our implementation uses a multi-layered approach to MIME type security:

- Validates MIME types against configurable allowed lists
- Performs content-based MIME type detection
- Compares claimed MIME type with detected content type
- Rejects files where content doesn't match the claimed type

### Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging

The system includes robust error handling:

- Detailed security event logging for upload attempts
- Structured error responses with specific failure reasons
- Null safety checks to prevent runtime errors
- Security event tracking for failed uploads

### Defense in Depth

The implementation follows a defense-in-depth approach:

- Multiple validation layers (extension, content, size, etc.)
- Context-aware validation based on upload purpose
- Proper file storage permissions
- Upload directory path protection

## Implementation Details

### Key Files

- `server/security/fileUploadSecurity.ts`: Core security module
- `server/routes/media.ts`: Integration of security features in routes
- `scripts/test-file-upload-security.js`: Test suite for security features

### Configuration

The file upload security module can be configured with:

```typescript
interface FileUploadSecurityConfig {
  maxFileSize: number;          // Maximum file size in bytes
  allowedFileTypes: {           // Allowed file types by category
    image: string[];            // Allowed image MIME types
    video: string[];            // Allowed video MIME types
    audio: string[];            // Allowed audio MIME types
    document: string[];         // Allowed document MIME types
    other: string[];            // Allowed other MIME types
  };
  allowedExtensions: {          // Allowed file extensions by category
    image: string[];            // Allowed image extensions
    video: string[];            // Allowed video extensions
    audio: string[];            // Allowed audio extensions
    document: string[];         // Allowed document extensions
    other: string[];            // Allowed other extensions
  };
  scanForMalware: boolean;      // Whether to scan for malware
  clamAVScanEndpoint?: string;  // ClamAV scanning endpoint
}
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify security features:

```bash
node scripts/test-file-upload-security.js
```

The test suite includes cases for:

- Valid uploads (should pass)
- Path traversal attempts
- Executable files disguised as images
- Files with double extensions
- Null byte injection attempts
- Empty files
- MIME type spoofing

## Best Practices for Developers

1. Always use the `validateUploadedFile` function for all file uploads
2. Never trust client-provided filenames or MIME types
3. Always validate file contents before storing them
4. Use proper error handling to catch and report security issues
5. Always specify allowed file categories for each upload context
6. Check the security logs for suspicious upload patterns

## Future Enhancements

Potential future security enhancements include:

1. Integration with ClamAV or another virus scanning solution
2. Implementation of file content sanitization for specific file types
3. Rate limiting for file uploads
4. Enhanced file metadata validation
5. Content-based image validation for more comprehensive security
