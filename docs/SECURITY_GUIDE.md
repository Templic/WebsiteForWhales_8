## Password Security

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid Common Patterns**: Don't use predictable patterns such as "12345" or "password".
- **Use Unique Passwords**: Never reuse passwords across different sites or services.
- **Password Manager**: Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
- **Change Regularly**: Update your password periodically, especially if you suspect any security compromise.

## Account Protection

- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Whenever available, enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to your account.
- **Verify Email and Recovery Options**: Keep your email address and recovery options up to date.
- **Monitor Account Activity**: Regularly check your account activity for any suspicious actions.
- **Log Out on Shared Devices**: Always log out of your account when using shared or public computers.
- **Be Cautious with Third-Party Apps**: Be selective about which third-party applications you grant access to your account.

## Safe Browsing

- **Verify Website Security**: Ensure you're on the correct website by checking the URL and looking for the secure padlock icon in your browser.
- **Be Wary of Links**: Don't click on links in emails or messages from unknown sources.
- **Keep Your Browser Updated**: Regularly update your web browser to the latest version.
- **Use Secure Networks**: Avoid conducting sensitive activities over public Wi-Fi networks.
- **Consider Using a VPN**: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can provide additional security when browsing online.

## Data Protection

- **Be Careful What You Share**: Only share necessary information; think twice before sharing sensitive personal details.
- **Review Privacy Settings**: Regularly review and adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your information.
- **Secure Your Devices**: Use device passwords, biometric locks, and encryption when available.
- **Backup Important Data**: Regularly backup important data to protect against loss.
- **Be Cautious with Downloads**: Only download files and applications from trusted sources.
