# Security Tools Guide

This guide explains how to use the security tools included in this application for comprehensive security scanning, auditing, and reporting.

## Overview

The security tools in this application include:

1. **Security Scanner**: Scans for vulnerabilities in the application
2. **Security Auditor**: Performs a comprehensive security audit
3. **Scheduled Security Scanner**: Automates regular security scanning
4. **Security Report Generator**: Creates detailed security reports

## Getting Started

All security tools can be run using the provided shell script:

```bash
./security.sh [command] [options]
```

Make sure the shell script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x security.sh
```

## Security Scanner

The security scanner checks for various vulnerabilities in the application, including:

- Outdated dependencies
- Hardcoded secrets
- Missing security headers
- Missing CSRF protection
- Inadequate input validation
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities

### Running a Security Scan

```bash
./security.sh scan
```

Options:
- `--quick`: Run a quick scan of critical components only
- `--full`: Run a comprehensive scan (default)
- `--fix`: Attempt to automatically fix detected issues
- `--report`: Generate a detailed report

Examples:
```bash
./security.sh scan --quick
./security.sh scan --full --report
```

## Security Auditor

The security auditor performs a comprehensive security audit against industry standards, including the OWASP Top 10.

### Running a Security Audit

```bash
./security.sh audit
```

Options:
- `--owasp`: Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- `--compliance`: Include compliance checks for GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- `--detailed`: Generate a detailed report with code snippets

Examples:
```bash
./security.sh audit --owasp
./security.sh audit --compliance --detailed
```

## Scheduled Security Scanner

The scheduled security scanner is designed to be run on a regular schedule to monitor the application's security posture over time.

### Running a Scheduled Security Scan

```bash
./security.sh scheduled
```

Options:
- `--notify`: Send notifications for detected issues
- `--compare`: Compare with previous scan results
- `--stats`: Update security statistics

Examples:
```bash
./security.sh scheduled --compare
./security.sh scheduled --notify --stats
```

## Security Report Generator

The security report generator creates various types of security reports based on scan results and security logs.

### Generating Security Reports

```bash
./security.sh report
```

Options:
- `--executive`: Generate an executive summary
- `--technical`: Generate a detailed technical report (default)
- `--compliance`: Generate a compliance report
- `--trends`: Generate a security trends report
- `--period=X`: Time period to include (day, week, month, quarter, year)

Examples:
```bash
./security.sh report --executive
./security.sh report --technical --period=month
./security.sh report --trends --period=quarter
```

## Setting Up Automated Security Scanning

To set up automated security scanning, you can use a cron job to run the scheduled security scanner at regular intervals:

```bash
# Run a weekly security scan every Sunday at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/your/app && ./security.sh scheduled --compare --stats
```

## Security Reports

All security reports are saved in the `reports` directory:

- Scan reports: `reports/security-scan-report-*.md`
- Audit reports: `reports/audits/security-audit-report-*.md`
- Executive summaries: `reports/security-executive-summary-*.md`
- Technical reports: `reports/security-technical-report-*.md`
- Compliance reports: `reports/security-compliance-report-*.md`
- Trends reports: `reports/security-trends-report-*.md`

## Security Scan Results

Raw scan results are saved in the `logs/security-scans` directory as JSON files.

## Security Statistics

Security statistics are updated over time and saved in `reports/security-stats.json`. These statistics are used to generate trends reports and track the application's security posture over time.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Scanning**: Run security scans at least weekly or after significant code changes
2. **Review Reports**: Regularly review security reports for new vulnerabilities
3. **Address Critical Issues**: Immediately address any critical or high severity issues
4. **Track Trends**: Monitor security trends over time to identify patterns
5. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
6. **Automated Scanning**: Set up automated security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline
7. **Security Training**: Provide security training for all developers
