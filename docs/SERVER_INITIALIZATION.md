## Initialization Stages

The server uses a staged initialization approach to optimize startup time and resource utilization. This approach ensures that critical services start first and non-critical services are deferred.

### Stage 1: Essential Services

The first stage starts the minimum required services for the server to function:

```typescript
// === STAGE 1: Essential Services ===
// Connect to database (critical)
const dbStartTime = Date.now();
await connectDB();
const dbConnectTime = Date.now() - dbStartTime;
log(`Database connected in ${dbConnectTime}ms`, 'server');
```

**Services started in Stage 1:**
- Database connection

### Stage 2: Core Server Components

The second stage starts the core server components required to handle HTTP requests:

```typescript
// === STAGE 2: Core Server Components ===
// Set up session with dynamic secret for security
const sessionSecret = process.env.SESSION_SECRET || crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');

// Set up middleware and routes
setupMiddleware(app, sessionSecret);
setupRoutes(app);

// Initialize WebSockets if enabled
if (config.features.enableWebSockets) {
  setupSocketIO(httpServer);
  setupWebSockets(httpServer);
}

// Set up Vite middleware in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  await createViteServer(app);
}

// Start listening for connections
const PORT = config.port;
httpServer.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  log(`Server successfully listening on port ${PORT}`, 'server');
});
```

**Services started in Stage 2:**
- Session management
- Middleware (body parsing, compression, CORS, etc.)
- Route handlers
- WebSockets (if enabled)
- Vite development server (development only)
- HTTP server listener

### Stage 3: Deferred Non-Critical Services

The third stage starts non-critical services with configurable delays:

```typescript
// === STAGE 3: Deferred Non-Critical Services ===
if (config.deferBackgroundServices) {
  initializeNonCriticalServices(); // With delays
} else {
  await initializeAllServices(); // Immediately
}
```

**Services started in Stage 3:**
- Database optimization
- Background services
- Security scans

Each non-critical service has its own delay configuration:

```typescript
// Initialize database optimization (if enabled)
if (config.features.enableDatabaseOptimization) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    scheduleIntelligentMaintenance();
  }, config.maintenanceDelay);
}

// Initialize background services (if enabled)
if (config.features.enableBackgroundTasks) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    initBackgroundServices();
  }, config.backgroundServicesDelay);
}

// Initialize security scans (if enabled)
if (config.features.enableSecurityScans) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    runDeferredSecurityScan();
  }, config.securityScanDelay);
}
```

## Configuration Options

The initialization process is controlled by various configuration options:

### Feature Toggles

- `config.features.enableWebSockets`: Enable/disable WebSocket server
- `config.features.enableBackgroundTasks`: Enable/disable background tasks
- `config.features.enableSecurityScans`: Enable/disable security scanning
- `config.features.enableAnalytics`: Enable/disable analytics collection
- `config.features.enableDatabaseOptimization`: Enable/disable database optimization
- `config.features.enableCaching`: Enable/disable response caching
- `config.features.enableRateLimiting`: Enable/disable rate limiting

### Deferred Initialization

- `config.deferBackgroundServices`: Whether to defer background services
- `config.deferDatabaseMaintenance`: Whether to defer database maintenance
- `config.deferSecurityScans`: Whether to defer security scans

### Delay Times

- `config.backgroundServicesDelay`: Delay before starting background services (ms)
- `config.maintenanceDelay`: Delay before starting database maintenance (ms)
- `config.securityScanDelay`: Delay before starting security scans (ms)

### Startup Priority and Mode

- `config.startupPriority`: Priority between speed and maintenance
- `config.startupMode`: Which features to enable

## Service Dependencies

Services have dependencies on other services that must be considered during initialization:

```
Database Connection
└── Session Management
    └── Route Handlers
        └── Background Services
            └── Database Maintenance
```

The staged initialization ensures that dependencies are satisfied before dependent services start.

## Startup Performance

Startup performance is tracked and reported in the server logs:

```
=== Server Startup Performance ===
Total startup time: 570ms
Startup priority: speed
Database optimization: enabled
Background services: enabled
Security scans: enabled
Non-critical services deferred: yes
=================================
```

Key metrics include:
- Total startup time
- Database connection time
- Features enabled
- Deferred services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Initialization Issues

1. **Database Connection Failure**

   If the database connection fails, the entire server initialization will fail since it's a critical dependency.

   **Solution**: Check database connection string, credentials, and ensure the database server is running.

2. **Port Already in Use**

   If the HTTP server can't bind to the configured port, initialization will fail.

   **Solution**: Change the port configuration or stop the process using the port.

3. **Slow Startup**

   If the server takes too long to start, it may be due to non-critical services running at startup.

   **Solution**: 
   - Set `config.deferBackgroundServices` to true
   - Set `config.startupPriority` to 'speed'
   - Set `config.startupMode` to 'minimal' or 'standard'

4. **High CPU/Memory Usage During Startup**

   If the server uses excessive resources during startup, it may be due to database maintenance running too early.

   **Solution**:
   - Increase `config.maintenanceDelay`
   - Set `config.startupPriority` to 'speed'

### Debugging Initialization

To debug the initialization process:

1. Set `config.logLevel` to 'debug' to get detailed logs
2. Check the server logs for timing information
3. Disable features one by one to identify problematic services
4. Use the performance metrics to identify slow stages

### Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. Set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to 'production'
2. Set `config.startupPriority` based on your needs:
   - 'speed' for fastest startup
   - 'balanced' for normal operation
   - 'maintenance' for maintenance periods
3. Set `config.startupMode` to 'full' to enable all features
4. Configure appropriate delay times for non-critical services

## Conclusion

The staged initialization process allows the server to start quickly while still performing all necessary tasks. By configuring the initialization behavior, you can optimize startup time and resource usage for your specific needs.
