# Implementation Plan for Repository Reorganization

This document outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the repository organization strategy defined in `REPOSITORY_ORGANIZATION.md`.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the reorganization:
1. Ensure all current code is committed to version control
2. Create a backup of the current repository state
3. Inform all team members of the upcoming changes

## Phase 1: Directory Structure Setup

### Step 1: Create New Directory Structure

```bash
# Create main directory structure
mkdir -p client/src/{assets,components,hooks,lib,pages,store,types}

# Create component subdirectories
mkdir -p client/src/components/{common,layout,features,imported}
mkdir -p client/src/components/features/{shop,music,cosmic,admin}
mkdir -p client/src/components/imported/{v0,lovable}

# Create pages subdirectories
mkdir -p client/src/pages/{admin,shop,archived}
```

### Step 2: Update Configuration Files

Update path aliases in `tsconfig.json` to reflect the new directory structure, ensuring imports will continue to work:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./client/src/*"],
      "@components/*": ["./client/src/components/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["./client/src/pages/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["./client/src/hooks/*"],
      "@lib/*": ["./client/src/lib/*"],
      "@assets/*": ["./client/src/assets/*"],
      "@types/*": ["./client/src/types/*"],
      "@store/*": ["./client/src/store/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Component Migration

### Step 1: Identify Component Categories

Review all components from:
- Current codebase (to be moved to appropriate location)
- v0 imports (to be placed in `components/imported/v0/`)
- lovable.dev imports (to be placed in `components/imported/lovable/`)

Create a spreadsheet tracking:
- Component name
- Current location
- Target location
- Dependencies
- Migration status

### Step 2: Move Current Components

For each component in the current codebase:

1. Identify the appropriate target directory
2. Move the component file
3. Update imports in all files that reference the component
4. Test the application to ensure the component still works

Example migration command:
```bash
# Move a component
mv client/src/OldComponentPath.tsx client/src/components/features/shop/NewComponentName.tsx

# Find and update imports (needs to be adapted to your specific case)
grep -r "import .* from .*OldComponentPath" client/src/ | xargs sed -i 's|OldComponentPath|components/features/shop/NewComponentName|g'
```

### Step 3: Process Imported Components

For each component from external sources (v0, lovable.dev):

1. Place the component in the appropriate `imported` subdirectory
2. Add a comment header documenting its origin
3. Test the component in isolation
4. Create an issue/task for future integration or replacement

## Phase 3: Page Reorganization

### Step 1: Current Pages

For each active page:

1. Move to the appropriate location in `client/src/pages/`
2. Update imports for components and utilities
3. Test to ensure the page functions correctly

### Step 2: Archived Pages

For legacy or redundant pages:

1. Move to `client/src/pages/archived/`
2. Add a comment header explaining why the page was archived
3. Comment out the route in `App.tsx` (but don't remove it)
4. Add a banner component to the page indicating it's archived/deprecated

### Step 3: Update Routing

Modify the central routing file(s) to reflect the new page organization:

1. Update import paths
2. Group routes logically
3. Add comments for clarity
4. Consider implementing a route management system for better organization

## Phase 4: Update Documentation

### Step 1: Update README

Update the main `README.md` to reflect the new structure and organization principles.

### Step 2: Component Documentation

For each major component, ensure there is documentation covering:
- Purpose and functionality
- Props/API
- Usage examples
- Dependencies

### Step 3: Update Architecture Docs

Update existing architecture documentation to reflect the new organization.

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### Step 1: Comprehensive Testing

Test all major application flows:
- Navigation between pages
- Core functionality
- Forms and data submission
- Admin features
- Shop functionality

### Step 2: Performance Validation

Verify that the reorganization hasn't negatively impacted:
- Build times
- Application load time
- Page transitions
- Overall responsiveness

## Phase 6: Cleanup

### Step 1: Remove Redundant Code

Identify and safely remove:
- Duplicated components
- Unused utilities
- Dead code paths

### Step 2: Dependency Cleanup

Review and update package dependencies:
- Remove unused packages
- Update version constraints
- Consolidate similar utilities

## Timeline and Milestones

| Phase | Estimated Time | Milestone |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Directory Structure | 1 day | Basic structure in place |
| Component Migration | 3-5 days | All components moved to new locations |
| Page Reorganization | 2-3 days | All pages in proper directories |
| Documentation | 1-2 days | Updated documentation |
| Testing | 2-3 days | All functionality validated |
| Cleanup | 1-2 days | Codebase optimized |

## Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies:

1. **Application Breakage**
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage
   - Have a rollback plan

2. **Import Path Issues**
   - Use path aliases where possible
   - Create helper scripts for bulk updates
   - Test thoroughly after each batch of changes

3. **Team Confusion**
   - Document changes clearly
   - Provide a "mapping" from old to new locations
   - Schedule a knowledge-sharing session after reorganization
