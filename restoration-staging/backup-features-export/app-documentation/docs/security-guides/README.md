## Using This Documentation These guides are organized to support different developer workflows: - **New to the security system?** Start with the [Security System Overview](1-security-system-overview.m

d)

- **Building a new feature?** Review the specific guides relevant to your feature's security requirements
- **Troubleshooting?** Each guide contains a troubleshooting section for common issues
- **Security enhancement?** Use these guides as reference for the current implementation

## Development Guidelines When extending or modifying the security system, follow these guidelines: 1. **Defense in Depth** - Never rely on a single security mechanis

m

2. **Fail Securely** - When a security mechanism fails, it should default to a secure state

3. **Least Privilege** - Components should only have the permissions they need

4. **Input Validation** - Always validate input data before processing

5. **Error Handling** - Security-related errors should be logged but with minimal exposure to users

6. **Performance Considerations** - Balance security and performance, especially for high-traffic routes

7. **Testing** - Include security-focused tests for all changes
