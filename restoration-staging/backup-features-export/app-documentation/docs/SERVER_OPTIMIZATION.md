## Configuration System The server uses a centralized configuration system that supports different environments, startup modes, and feature toggles. This allows for fine-grained control over how the server behaves without code changes. ### Key Features - **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects and applies the correct configuration for development, staging, production, or test environment

s.

- **Feature Toggles**: Enable or disable specific server features through configuration.
- **Priority Settings**: Configure startup behavior by setting priority between speed and maintenance.
- **Environment Variables**: Override configuration through environment variables.

```typescript
// Example of setting startup priority and mode

process.env.STARTUP_PRIORITY = 'speed'; // Options: 'speed', 'balanced', 'maintenance'

process.env.STARTUP_MODE = 'minimal'; // Options: 'minimal', 'standard', 'full'
```

## Staged Initialization The server implements a staged initialization approach that improves startup time by: 1. **Essential Services First**: Critical services like database connection start immediatel

y.

2. **Early Listener Start**: HTTP server starts listening as early as possible.

3. **Deferred Non-Critical Services**: Background tasks, maintenance, and security scans are deferred. ### Benefits - **Faster API Availability**: Server is ready to handle requests in ~500ms vs. several second

s.

- **Better Resource Management**: Resource-intensive operations are spread out over time.
- **Improved Reliability**: Critical services start even if non-critical services fail.

## Database Optimization Intelligent database maintenance improves performance and reduces resource consumption. ### Features - **Intelligent VACUUM**: Only vacuums tables with high dead tuple count

s.

- **Targeted Reindexing**: Only reindexes fragmented indices.
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Performs major maintenance during off-peak hours (3 AM).
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects and stores database performance metrics. ### Configuration Options - Enable/disable database optimization: `config.features.enableDatabaseOptimizatio

n`
- Set maintenance delay: `config.maintenanceDelay`
- Control maintenance mode: Based on `startupPriority` ('maintenance' = full, 'speed' = minimal)

## Background Services Background services are managed efficiently to reduce startup impact while ensuring all required tasks run. ### Included Services - **Session Cleanup**: Automatically removes expired session

s.

- **Metrics Collection**: Gathers system and database metrics.
- **System Heartbeat**: Monitors memory usage and uptime. ### Configuration Options - Enable/disable background tasks: `config.features.enableBackgroundTask

s`
- Set background services delay: `config.backgroundServicesDelay`

## Security Scans Security scanning is configurable to balance between security and performance. ### Features - **Scheduled Scans**: Performs full security scans on a schedul

e.

- **Issue Tracking**: Tracks and reports security issues.
- **Different Scan Types**: Supports 'quick', 'full', and 'targeted' scans. ### Configuration Options - Enable/disable security scans: `config.features.enableSecurityScan

s`
- Set security scan delay: `config.securityScanDelay`

## Environment-Specific Settings The server provides different default settings optimized for each environment: ### Development - Faster startup with minimal background service

s

- Debug-level logging
- Disabled rate limiting and caching
- Smaller connection pool (5 connections) ### Production - Balanced settings with focus on reliabilit

y
- Warning-level logging (reduced verbosity)
- Full feature set enabled
- Larger connection pool (20 connections)
- HTTPS enabled
- Stricter CORS configuration ### Test - Minimal feature set for fast testin

g
- Error-level logging only
- No background services or security scans
- Minimal connection pool (2 connections)

## Startup Modes The server supports different startup modes to control which features are enabled: ### Minimal Mode - Only essential service

s

- No background tasks, security scans, analytics, database optimization
- Fastest possible startup ### Standard Mode - Default mode with balanced feature

s
- Includes background tasks, security scans, analytics, database optimization
- Moderate startup speed ### Full Mode - All features enable

d
- Includes caching, rate limiting, and all optimization features
- Slowest startup but most complete feature set

## Performance Metrics The server tracks and reports startup and runtime performance metrics: - Total startup tim

e

- Database connection time
- Active feature set
- Memory usage over time
- Database performance statistics These metrics can be used to further optimize the server configuration. ---

## Usage Recommendations 1. **Development**: Use `speed` priority and `standard` mode for fast startup with basic feature

s.

2. **Testing**: Use `speed` priority and `minimal` mode for fastest possible startup.

3. **Production**: Use `balanced` priority and `full` mode for complete feature set with reasonable startup time.

4. **Maintenance**: Use `maintenance` priority and `full` mode when performing system maintenance.

## Adding New Services When adding new services to the server: 1. Make the service configurable through the central configuration syste

m.

2. Support deferred initialization if the service is non-critical.

3. Add appropriate logging with the 'log' utility.

4. Consider the impact on startup time and resource usage.

5. Implement graceful startup and shutdown behavior.
