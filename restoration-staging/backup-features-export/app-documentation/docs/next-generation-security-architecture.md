```typescript
// Sample analysis of a request for anomalies

const result = mlEngine.analyzeRequestBehavior(req, securityContext);

if (result.isAnomaly && result.confidence > 0.7) {
 console.warn(`High-confidence anomaly detected: ${result.anomalyScore.toFixed(2)}`);
 // Take defensive action
}

s

```typescript
// Generate a quantum-resistant key pair

const keyPair = quantumCrypto.generateKeyPair(QuantumAlgorithmType.LATTICE_NTRU);

// Encrypt data using quantum-resistant encryption

const encryptedData = quantumCrypto.encrypt(sensitiveData, keyPair.publicKey);

// Sign data using quantum-resistant signatures

const signature = quantumCrypto.sign(dataToSign, keyPair.privateKey);
``` ### 4. Blockchain-Based Immutable Security Audit Logs Our audit logging system uses blockchain concepts to create tamper-evident logs that can detect any attempts to modify the security audit trail. #### Key Features - **Tamper-Evident Design**: Any modification to logs can be detected through chain validatio

 message: 'Failed login attempt from unusual location',
 user: 'user123',
 ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
 metadata: { location: 'Unknown location', attempts: 5 }
});

// Validate the integrity of the blockchain

const validationResult = await securityBlockchain.validateChain();

console.log(`Security log integrity: ${validationResult.valid ? 'Valid' : 'Compromised'}`);
``` ### 5. Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) Our Runtime Application Self-Protection system provides real-time security monitoring and protection during application execution, detecting and preventing attacks at runtime. #### Key Features - **Real-time Attack Detection**: Monitors application behavior to detect attacks during executio

s

```typescript
// Use RASP middleware to protect API routes

app.use(raspMiddleware);

// Configure different levels of protection for different routes

app.use('/api/public', raspMonitoringMiddleware); // Only monitor

app.use('/api/sensitive', raspDetectionMiddleware); // Detect but don't block

app.use('/api/critical', raspMiddleware); // Detect and block

// Add a custom RASP rule

raspManager.addRule({
 id: 'RASP-CUSTOM-001',
 name: 'Custom Business Logic Protection',
 description: 'Custom rule to protect specific business logic',
 category: RASPProtectionCategory.BUSINESS_LOGIC,
 severity: SecurityEventSeverity.HIGH,
 patterns: [/suspicious-pattern/i],
 context: 'all',
 remediation: 'Implement proper validation for business rules',
 enabled: true
});
``` ### 6. Maximum Security Scanning Our security scanning system provides comprehensive proactive detection of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security issues across the application. #### Key Features - **Deep Code Analysis**: Automatically scans all code for security vulnerabilitie

s

// Run a maximum security scan

const scanResults = await maximumSecurityScanner.scan();

// Get critical findings

const criticalIssues = scanResults.filter(result => result.severity === 'critical');

console.log(`Found ${criticalIssues.length} critical security issues`);
```

## Security Posture Levels The system adapts its security controls based on the current threat environment, allowing for a dynamic response to changing security conditions: | Level | Description | Effect

s |

|-------|-------------|---------|

| Normal | Default security level | Standard security controls |
| Elevated | Increased threat awareness | Stricter validation, reduced session times |

| High | Active threats detected | Much stricter validation, additional verification |
| Maximum | Critical security situation | Most restrictive settings, minimum trust |

 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
 [userId]
 );

 // Execute the validated query
 return db.query(query, parameters);
}
``` ### Securing Sensitive Dat

a
