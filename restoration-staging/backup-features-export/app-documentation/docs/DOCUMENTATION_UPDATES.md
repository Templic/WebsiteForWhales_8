# Documentation Updates Guid

e

 best practices for maintaining and updating documentation in the project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency and completeness across all documentation.

## Documentation Structure The project documentation is organized in the following locations: - `/docs/` - Core documentation and guides - `/docs/examples/` - Example templates and patterns - `/docs/features/` - Feature-specific documentation - `/docs/security/` - Security-related documentation - `/docs/replit-integration/` - Replit integration documentatio

n

- `/dev-docs/` - Development-specific documentation and plans
- `/reports/` - Security reports and audits
- `/scripts/README.md` - Documentation for utility scripts
- Component-level README files - In each feature directory

## Documentation Update Process ### When to Update Documentation Documentation should be updated in the following situations: 1. **Feature Changes**: - When new features are added to the application - When existing features are modified or deprecated - When feature behavior changes 2. **Security Updates**: - When security vulnerabilities are fixed - After security audits are completed - When security practices are updated - After periodic security scans 3. **Codebase Changes**: - When the repository structure changes - When significant code patterns change - When dependency versions change - When deployment procedures change 4. **Process Changes**: - When new processes or workflows are implemented - When tools or procedures are updated - When roles or responsibilities change 5. **Documentation Maintenance**: - When issues are discovered in existing documentation - During periodic documentation reviews - When documentation organization changes ### How to Update Documentation Follow these steps when updating documentation: 1. **Identify relevant documents** - Determine which documentation files need to be update

d

2. **Review current content** - Understand the existing documentation before making changes

3. **Make targeted updates** - Focus on specific sections that need updating

4. **Maintain formatting** - Keep consistent with the existing format and style

5. **Update timestamps** - Add or update the last-modified date at the bottom of the document

6. **Cross-reference** - Update related documents if necessary ### Documentation Best Practices 1. **Be concise** - Use clear, straightforward languag

e

2. **Use examples** - Include practical examples where helpful

3. **Include code snippets** - Provide relevant code examples

4. **Maintain structure** - Follow the existing document structure

5. **Use proper formatting** - Use Markdown formatting consistently

6. **Check links** - Ensure all links to other documents or external resources work

7. **Version information** - Include version information where relevant

## Security Documentation When updating security-related documentation: 1. **Never include sensitive information** - Keep secrets, keys, and internal vulnerabilities privat

e

2. **Be specific about fixes** - Detail what was fixed without revealing exploitable information

3. **Include verification steps** - Document how fixes were verified

4. **Reference standards** - Reference relevant security standards or best practices

5. **Update compliance status** - Update compliance documents if security status changes

## Documentation Review Before finalizing documentation updates: 1. **Technical accuracy** - Ensure all technical information is correc

t

2. **Completeness** - Check that all necessary information is included

3. **Clarity** - Verify that the documentation is understandable

4. **Consistency** - Check for consistency with other documentation

5. **Formatting** - Verify proper Markdown formatting

## Documentation Templates For new documentation files, consider following this basic structur

e:

```markdown

# Document Titl

e

## Overvie

w

Brief description of the topic.

## Key Section

s

Main content organized into sections.

### Sub-section

s

## Component Documentation When documenting components: 1. **Follow the Component Documentation Guide**: Use the standards in `COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.m

d`

2. **Use proper JSDoc comments**: Include all required sections

3. **Document props thoroughly**: Explain each prop's purpose and type

4. **Include examples**: Show how to use the component

5. **Cross-reference related components**: Help developers understand component relationships

6. **Update deprecation notices**: Mark deprecated components appropriately See the [Component Documentation Guide](COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed standards.

## Feature Documentation When documenting features: 1. **Create a feature README**: Each feature directory should have a README.m

d

2. **List all components**: Include descriptions of each component

3. **Provide integration examples**: Show how to use the feature

4. **Document dependencies**: List any dependencies or requirements

5. **Include usage limitations**: Note any limitations or constraints

## Documentation for New Developers The following documentation should be maintained for onboarding new developers: 1. **Architecture Overview**: High-level understanding of the syste

m

2. **Repository Structure**: How the codebase is organized

3. **Development Workflow**: How to develop, test, and deploy

4. **Component Standards**: How to create and use components

5. **Feature Guidelines**: How to add or modify features

## Automated Documentation Updates When security scanners, dependency updaters, or other automated tools run, ensure the relevant documentation is updated to reflect: 1. **Scan Results**: When the last scan was performed and its outcom

e

2. **Identified Issues**: What vulnerabilities or issues were found

3. **Remediation Steps**: What actions were taken to address issues

4. **Current Status**: Present security posture and remaining tasks

5. **Future Plans**: Scheduled improvements or upcoming changes This can be done manually or through automated scripts that update documentation files with the latest information.

## Documentation Review Cycle Establish regular review cycles for documentation: | Documentation Type | Review Frequency | Responsible Rol

e |

|-------------------|------------------|------------------|

| Core Documentation | Quarterly | Tech Lead |
| Security Documentation | Monthly | Security Lead |

| Component Documentation | With each sprint | Frontend Lead |
| Feature Documentation | With each feature update | Feature Owner |

| Development Documentation | Monthly | Dev Team Lead |

## Conclusion Good documentation is a critical part of a maintainable codebase. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and useful for all developers working on the project. --- *Last updated: 2025-04-1
