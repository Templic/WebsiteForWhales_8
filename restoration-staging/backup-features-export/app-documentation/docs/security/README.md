# Security Documentati

o

n **Version:** 1.0 **Last Updated:** 2025-05-18 **Status:** Active **Author:** Security Team **AI-Index:** This document provides a central access point to all security documentation, covering our multi-layered defense-in-depth security architecture, key protection mechanisms, and implementation guides.

## Overview Our platform uses a defense-in-depth approach to protect your data and systems. This means we build security at every level - from the network to the data itself. This guide helps you find the security documentation you need quickly and understand how our security systems work togethe

r.

## Why Security Matters Strong security protect s: - Your sensitive user dat

a

- Your system from unauthorized access
- Your reputation with customers
- Your compliance with regulations

## Security Architecture Our security works in four layers that protect your system from different types of threats: ### 1. Network Security Laye r Protects your system at the connection leve

l:

- Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks malicious traffic
- DDoS protection prevents overwhelming traffic
- HTTPS encrypts all communications
- HSTS ensures secure connections ### 2. Application Security Laye r Secures the application code and logi

c:
- Strong authentication verifies user identity
- Input validation blocks malicious data
- Output encoding prevents injection attacks
- CSRF tokens stop cross-site attacks
- Security headers block common web vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting prevents abuse ### 3. Data Security Laye r Protects your valuable informatio

n:
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure database connections
- Least privilege access controls
- Regular data backups ### 4. Infrastructure Security Laye r Secures the underlying system

s:
- Hardened server configurations
- Regular security patching
- Container security controls

## Getting Started If you're new to our security systems: 1. Start with the [Security Overview](SECURITY.
