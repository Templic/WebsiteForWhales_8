# Embedded Content Security Changelo

g

## Version 1.0.0 (2025-05-08) ### Overview This update implements a comprehensive solution for embedded content security issues, specifically addressing YouTube videos and Google Maps embeds that were previously blocked by CSRF protection and CSP restrictions. The implementation uses a server-side proxy approach to serve embedded content from our own domain, eliminating cross-origin issues and security conflicts. ### Added #### Server Components - **Embed Proxy Routes**: Added new routes in `server/routes/embed-proxy-routes.ts` that serve YouTube videos and Google Maps from our own domain - `/api/embed/youtube/:videoId`: Serves YouTube videos with custom security headers - `/api/embed/maps/:query`: Serves Google Maps with appropriate security configuration - **Security Middleware**: Implemented specialized middleware for embedded content - Added `server/middleware/embedContentCsrfBypass.ts` to bypass CSRF protection for embed routes - Added `server/middleware/cspBypassMiddleware.ts` to modify CSP headers for embedded content - Enhanced route registration in `server/routes.ts` with explicit security bypasses for embed routes #### Client Components - **React Components**: Added new React components for secure content embedding - Added `ProxyYouTubeEmbed` component for easy YouTube video embedding - Added `ProxyGoogleMapEmbed` component for Google Maps integration - Created `ExternalEmbedContext` and provider for centralized embed security management #### Documentation - **User Guides**: Added comprehensive documentation for the embedded content security system - `EMBEDDED-CONTENT-SECURITY.md`: Technical documentation of the architecture and implementation - `EMBEDDING-CONTENT-GUIDE.md`: User-focused guide for embedding external content - `SECURITY-CONFIGURATION-EMBEDDED-CONTENT.md`: Security configuration reference - `EMBEDDED-CONTENT-CHANGELOG.md`: This changelog document ### Changed #### Security Configuration - **CSRF Protection**: Modified CSRF protection to exempt embedded content routes - Added `/api/embed/youtube/*` and `/api/embed/maps/*` to CSRF exempt routes list - Implemented request-level CSRF bypassing with `__skipCSRF` flag - **Content Security Policy**: Enhanced CSP configuration for embedded content - Created specialized CSP configurations for YouTube and Google Maps content - Added all relevant domains to allowed sources lists - Implemented route-specific CSP header modifications #### Application Pages - **Tour Page**: Updated YouTube video and Google Map components - Replaced direct embeds with `ProxyYouTubeEmbed` and `ProxyGoogleMapEmbed` components - Updated video content to "Celestial Harmonies" (ID: jzpvkq3Krjg) - Changed map to show Rainbow Falls, Hilo, Hawaii with zoom level 6 to display all Hawaiian islands - **Music Pages**: Updated embeds on music-related pages - Applied proxy components to archived music and new music pages - Enhanced security exemptions for all music route patterns ### Fixed - **CSRF Blocking Issues**: Resolved CSRF token validation failures for embedded content - Fixed "Invalid CSRF token" errors when loading YouTube videos - Eliminated refresh loop issues on pages with embedded content - **CSP Violations**: Resolved Content Security Policy violations - Fixed "Refused to load frame" CSP errors for YouTube and Google Maps - Eliminated related console errors about frame-ancestors and frame-src directives - **Cross-Origin Failures**: Addressed cross-origin resource sharing failures - Fixed YouTube playback issues related to cross-origin restrictions - Resolved Google Maps loading failures on certain browsers ### Security Considerations This update deliberately relaxes certain security protections for specific routes to allow embedded content to function correctly. These changes: 1. Are limited to the minimum necessary paths and domain

s

2. Include extensive logging for security auditing

3. Maintain strict input validation to prevent injection attacks

4. Preserve robust security for all non-embedded content routes ### Known Issues - Certain browsers may still show CSP warnings in the developer console, although content loads correctl

y

- YouTube autoplay functionality may be limited by browser autoplay restrictions
- Google Maps performance may vary depending on query specificity and zoom level ### Future Improvements - Consider implementing a caching layer for embed proxy response

s
- Add support for more external content providers (e.g., Vimeo, Spotify)
- Enhance logging and monitoring specific to embedded content security exemptions
- Explore using Web Workers for improved isolation of embedded content
