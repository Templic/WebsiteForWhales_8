d e best practices for integrating with the application's security system when developing components, pages, or features.

## Security System Integration Fundamentals ### 1. Understand the Security System Architecture The application uses a multi-layered security system: 1. **Authentication Layer**: Controls user identity and acces s 2. **Authorization Layer**: Controls permissions based on roles 3. **CSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery 4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request volume control 5. **Content Security**: Controls embedded content and scripts 6. **Monitoring/Logging**: Records security events for analysis ### 2. Common Integration Challenges #### Circular Dependencies One of the most common issues is circular dependency between security components. For exampl e: - The security dashboard needs authentication to be secur e - But if authentication fails, you need the security dashboard to diagnose problems **Solution**: Follow the Security Context pattern and use security bypass registry #### Integration with Embedded Content Embedded content creates security risks if not properly managed, but overly strict policies can break legitimate content. **Solution**: Use the Security Context pattern to make domain-based security decision

## Security Context Pattern ### Implementation Guide 1. Use the `useSecurityContext` hook to access security configuration s 2. Never build direct dependencies between security components 3. Create fallback mechanisms for all security-dependent component

s

```typescript

import { useSecurityContext } from '@/hooks/useSecurityContext';

function MySecureComponent() {
 const { isAllowedDomain, securityLogger } = useSecurityContext();

 // Log security events
 securityLogger.logSecurityEvent({
 type: 'component_access',
 details: { componentName: 'MySecureComponent' },
 severity: 'info'
 });

 // Make domain-based security decisions
 const isSafeDomain = isAllowedDomain('example.com');

 return (
 // Component implementation
 );
}
```

## Security Bypass Registry For components that need to function even during security incidents (like security dashboard s), register their routes in the security bypass registry. ### Implementation 1. Add routes to the `security-bypasses.ts` configuratio n 2. Use direct API endpoints for these components 3. Always implement fallback mechanisms ### Exampl

e:

```typescript

// In server/config/security-bypasses.ts

export const authExemptRoutes = [
 '/api/security/direct/*' // Security dashboard direct API
];

export const csrfExemptRoutes = [
 '/api/security/direct/*' // Security dashboard direct API
];
```

## Dashboard Implementation Best Practices 1. **Implement Fallback Data**: Always provide fallback data in case API calls fai l 2. **Use Direct API Routes**: Use authentication-exempt routes for security diagnostics 3. **Indicate Fallback Mode**: Clearly communicate to users when fallback data is in use 4. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure components work even with partial data 5. **Avoid Circular Security Dependencies**: Dashboard must work even when security is compromise

## Security System Integration Checklist Before integrating with the security system: - [ ] Reviewed security system architectur e - [ ] Identified potential circular dependencie s - [ ] Created fallback mechanisms for security service

s

- [ ] Used the Security Context pattern where appropriate
- [ ] Registered required exemptions in security bypass registry
- [ ] Added appropriate fallback data
- [ ] Tested component under security failure conditions

## API Security Integration When integrating with APIs: 1. **Rate Limit Awareness**: Respect and handle rate limits properl y 2. **Authentication Fallbacks**: Have fallback mechanisms for authentication failures 3. **CSRF Token Handling**: Always include CSRF tokens in requests where appropriate 4. **Error Handling**: Handle security errors gracefully with fallback state

s

## Embedded Content Security When embedding external content: 1. **Domain Validation**: Always validate domains against allowlis t 2. **Content Security Policy**: Set appropriate CSP directives 3. **Sandbox External Content**: Use appropriate sandbox attributes 4. **Fallback Content**: Provide fallback when content cannot be embedde

d

## Common Mistakes to Avoid 1. ❌ Adding security exemptions reactively instead of planning them in advanc e 2. ❌ Creating circular dependencies between security components 3. ❌ Failing to implement fallback mechanisms 4. ❌ Hard-coding security decisions instead of using the Security Context 5. ❌ Not testing component behavior during security incident
