# Documentation Standard

s

**Version:** 1.1 **Last Updated:** 2025-05-18 **Status:** Active **AI-Index:** This document establishes the comprehensive standards for creating and maintaining documentation throughout the project. It covers document structure, formatting rules, metadata requirements, cross-referencing conventions, and quality metrics. These standards ensure consistent, high-quality documentation that serves both users and developers effectively while supporting the documentation system's automated tools, quality checks, and navigation features.

## Overview This document defines the standards and guidelines for all documentation within the project. By following these standards, we ensure our documentation is consistent, complete, maintainable, and useful to both users and developer

s.

## Document Structure ### Required Sections Each document must include the following sections in this order: 1. **Title (H1)** - A clear, descriptive title at the top of the documen

t

2. **Metadata Block** - Immediately after the title, containing required metadata fields

3. **Overview** - A brief introduction explaining the document's purpose and scope

4. **Main Content Sections** - The primary content organized with appropriate headings

5. **Related Documents** - Links to related or referenced documentation

6. **Version History** - A record of document changes over time ### Heading Structure Organize headings hierarchically without skipping levels: - `# H1` - Document title (only one per documen

t)

- `## H2` - Major section

s
- `### H3` - Subsection

s
- `#### H4` - Lower-level section

s
- `##### H5` - Rarely used, but available for deep hierarchies ### Section Guidelines 1. **Overview Section** - Provide a concise summary of the document's purpose - Explain what readers will learn or achieve - Keep to 1-3 paragraphs 2. **Content Sections** - Use descriptive headings that clearly indicate the section's content - Begin each section with an introductory paragraph - Keep sections focused on a single topic or concept - Use consistent depth across similar documents 3. **Related Documents Section** - Include links to prerequisite documents - Reference documents that provide additional context - Link to documents that cover related topics - Format as a bulleted list with descriptive link text 4. **Version History Section** - Format as a table with columns for Version, Date, and Changes - List entries in reverse chronological order (newest first) - Include the initial document creation as version 1.

## Metadata Requirements ### Required Metadata Fields Include these metadata fields immediately after the document titl

e:

```markdown

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Active|Draft|Deprecated|Archived]
**AI-Index:** [Concise summary of document purpose and contents for AI processing]
``` ### Optional Metadata Fields These fields may be included based on document type and purpos

e:

```markdown
**Author:** [Document author or team]
**Reviewers:** [People who reviewed the document]
**Audience:** [Target audience, e.g., Developers, Administrators, End Users]
**Prerequisites:** [Required knowledge or documents to read first]
**Expiration:** [Date when the document should be reviewed or updated]
``` ### Status Values - **Active**: Current, maintained documentatio

n
- **Draft**: Work in progress, not yet complete
- **Deprecated**: Still accessible but will be removed/replaced
- **Archived**: Historical documentation, no longer maintained

## Formatting Guidelines ### Text Formatting - Use **bold** for emphasis and UI element

s

- Use *italic* for introducing new terms or light emphasis
- Use `code formatting` for code, commands, file names, and technical values
- Use > blockquotes for important notes or callouts ### Lists - Use ordered lists (1., 2., 3.) for sequential steps or prioritized item

s
- Use unordered lists (-) for non-sequential items
- Maintain consistent list formatting throughout the document
- Indent sublists consistently (4 spaces) ### Code Blocks - Always specify the language for syntax highlightin

g:

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code block

function example() {
 console.log("Hello, world!");
}
``` - For configuration files or output, specify the format:

```yaml
# Example YAML configuratio

n

name: example

version: 1.0

enabled: true
``` - For terminal commands, use the `bash` language identifier and prefix commands with `$`:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
``` ### Tables - Use tables for structured data and comparison

s
- Always include a header row
- Align columns consistently
- Keep tables simple and readable Example: | Name | Type | Description |

|------|------|-------------|

| id | string | Unique identifier |
| name | string | User-friendly name |

| enabled | boolean | Whether the feature is enabled |

### Links - Use descriptive link text that indicates the destinatio

n

- Prefer relative links for internal documentation
- Include title text for external links Examples:
- Internal: `[Authentication Guide](../security/authentication.md)`
- External: `[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla Developer Network")` ### Images - Include alt text for all image

s
- Keep images reasonably sized
- Provide captions for complex images
- Store images in an `/images` directory within the documentation folder Example:

```markdown
![System architecture diagram showing the relationship between components](./images/system-architecture.png)
```

## Content Guidelines ### Language and Style - Use clear, concise languag

e

- Write in present tense
- Use active voice when possible
- Address the reader directly using "you"
- Avoid jargon, slang, and colloquialisms
- Define acronyms on first use ### Technical Content - Provide context before diving into technical detail

s
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Explain why, not just how
- Include error messages and troubleshooting steps where appropriate
- Keep code examples concise and focused on the topic ### Document Types #### READMEs - Place at the root of a directory or projec

t
- Provide an overview of the directory/project contents
- Include quick start information
- Link to more detailed documentation #### How-To Guides - Focus on achieving specific task

s

- Include prerequisites and expected outcomes
- Provide complete working examples #### Reference Documentation - Organize alphabetically or by logical groupin

g
- Be comprehensive and precise
- Include parameter/return types and descriptions
- Link to related references #### Conceptual Documentation - Explain the "why" behind designs and approache

s
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Connect concepts to implementation
- Reference relevant external resources or research

## Cross-Referencing ### Internal References - Use relative links for cross-references between document

s

- Prefer linking to specific sections when referencing part of a document
- Use consistent terminology when referring to other documents ### External References - Include the full URL for external reference

s
- Provide context for why the external reference is relevant
- Consider including a brief summary of the external content
- Verify external links periodically

## Document Lifecycle ### Creation 1. Start with a template appropriate for the document typ

e

2. Complete required metadata fields

3. Structure according to the guidelines 4. Request review from relevant stakeholders ### Maintenance 1. Update when related features or processes chang

e

2. Review at least every 6 months

3. Update the "Last Updated" metadata when changes are made

4. Increment the version number for significant changes

5. Record changes in the Version History section ### Deprecation 1. Mark status as "Deprecated" in metadat

a

2. Add deprecation notice at the top of the document

3. Link to replacement documentation if available

4. Set an expiration date if known ### Archiving 1. Mark status as "Archived" in metadat

a

2. Move to an archive location or repository
