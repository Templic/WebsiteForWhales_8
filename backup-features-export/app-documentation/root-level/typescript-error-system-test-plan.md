# TypeScript Error Management System - Test Pl

a

n the comprehensive testing strategy for the TypeScript Error Management System, detailing test objectives, testing levels, and the execution approach.

## 1. Test Objectives The TypeScript Error Management System testing aims to verify: - Accurate detection of TypeScript errors in codebas e - Proper error categorization and severity assessmen

t

- Effective analysis of error relationships and dependencies
- Intelligent model selection for AI-powered analysis
- Secure handling of code and analysis results
- Performance in large codebases with timeout prevention
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions

## 2. Testing Levels ### 2.1 Unit Testing Unit tests will verify individual components of the system: - **Model Selection Strategy**: Test the selection of appropriate AI models based on different context s - **Logger**: Test log formatting, redaction of sensitive information, and different log level

s

- **Cache Manager**: Test caching functions, TTL enforcement, and invalidation
- **Utility Functions**: Test helper functions, file operations, and type analyzers
- **Analysis Functions**: Test error analysis without making actual API calls ### 2.2 Integration Testing Integration tests will verify interactions between components: - **Scanner + Analyzer**: Test the pipeline from finding errors to analyzing the

m
- **Analyzer + AI Integration**: Test proper AI integration with fallback mechanisms
- **CLI + Core Components**: Test command-line arguments properly affecting behavior
- **Security Scanner + Error Scanner**: Test combined scanning for comprehensive analysis ### 2.3 System Testing System tests will verify the complete workflow: - **End-to-End Workflow**: Test the entire process from scanning to fixin

g
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Test CI/CD integration with PR comments
- **Performance Testing**: Test with large codebases to verify scale handling
- **Security Testing**: Test handling of vulnerable code patterns ### 2.4 AI Model Testing Verify the AI-powered features: - **OpenAI Integration**: Test connectivity, prompt construction, and response parsin

g
- **Anthropic Integration**: Test connectivity, prompt construction, and response parsing
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Test automatic failover between providers
- **Token Usage Optimization**: Test efficient use of API calls

## 3. Test Environment - **Local Development**: Test in development environment with limited file coun t - **CI Pipeline**: Test in GitHub Actions with real repositorie

s

- **Large Codebase**: Test with significant TypeScript projects (>1000 files)

## 4. Test Data - **Sample Files**: Use the vulnerable code samples in `samples/vulnerable-cod e/` - **Real TypeScript Projects**: Use open-source TypeScript projects of different size

s

- **Edge Cases**: Create specifically crafted files to test edge cases

## 5. Test Execution Checklist ### 5.1 Model Selection Tests - [ ] Test selection with different error categorie s - [ ] Test selection with different task type

s

- [ ] Test selection with different severity levels
- [ ] Test selection with prioritizing speed vs. accuracy
- [ ] Test fallback selection when primary API is unavailable ### 5.2 Error Detection Tests - [ ] Test detection of syntax error

s
- [ ] Test detection of type errors
- [ ] Test detection of import errors
- [ ] Test detection of security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test proper snippet extraction around errors ### 5.3 Security Vulnerability Tests - [ ] Test detection of SQL injection vulnerabilitie

s
- [ ] Test detection of XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test detection of authentication issues
- [ ] Test detection of unsafe type assertions
- [ ] Test detection of information leakage ### 5.4 CI/CD Integration Tests - [ ] Test GitHub Actions workflow file generatio

n
- [ ] Test GitHub PR comment creation
- [ ] Test failing builds on high-severity issues
- [ ] Test creating accurate error annotations ### 5.5 Performance Tests - [ ] Test scanning small projects (<50 file

s)
- [ ] Test scanning medium projects (50-500 files)
- [ ] Test scanning large projects (>500 files)
- [ ] Test concurrent scanning performance
- [ ] Test memory usage during large scans ### 5.6 AI Analysis Tests - [ ] Test analysis of simple type error

s
- [ ] Test analysis of complex dependency errors
- [ ] Test suggested fixes accuracy
- [ ] Test response caching
- [ ] Test fallback between providers

## 6. Test Automation The tests are automated through the following scripts: - **Unit Tests**: `test-ts-error-system.t s` - **Integration Tests**: `test-ts-error-integration.t

s`

- **Performance Tests**: `test-ts-error-performance.ts`
- **Security Tests**: `test-security-scanner.ts`

## 7. Test Dependencies - Access to OpenAI API (for analysis feature s) - Access to Anthropic API (for analysis feature

s)

- GitHub token for testing PR integration

## 8. Risks and Mitigations | Risk | Mitigati

o

n | |------|------------|

| API rate limits | Implement caching, batching, and rate limiting |

| Timeouts in large codebases | Implement scanners with concurrency control |

| Memory issues with large files | Stream file contents rather than loading entirely |

| False positives | Maintain an allow list for approved patterns |

| False negatives | Regular updates to detection patterns |

## 9. Exit Criteria Testing is considered complete when: - All automated tests pass consistentl y - Performance meets targets (scanning 1000 files in under 2 minute

s)

- System can scan and analyze a real-world TypeScript project
- CI/CD integration works in a real GitHub Actions workflow

## 10. Test Schedule 1. Unit tests development: Complet e 2. Integration tests development: In progress 3. Performance testing: Planned 4. Security testing: Planned 5. CI/CD integration testing: In progres

s

## 11. Reporting Test results will be automatically documented in: - JSON reports: `reports/test-results.jso n` - Markdown summaries: `reports/test-summary.m

d`

- GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD tests

## 12. Approvals This test plan must be reviewed and approved by the project lead before execution. Test results must be reviewed before major release
