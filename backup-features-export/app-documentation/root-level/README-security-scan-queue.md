2. Ensure proper scan prioritization

3. Maintain scan execution history

4. Support advanced scan scheduling

## Components ### 1. Main Security Components - **Security Scan Queue**: Manages the sequential execution of security scan

s

- **Secure Audit Trail**: Provides tamper-evident logging to meet PCI-DSS Requirement 10.5
- **Log Review System**: Automatically reviews security logs to meet PCI-DSS Requirement 10.6
- **Dependency Updater**: Manages dependencies and identifies security vulnerabilities ### 2. Supporting Components - **System Monitor**: Tracks system resource utilization during scan

s
- **Background Services**: Manages long-running tasks including security scans
- **Security Scan Manager**: API endpoints for triggering and monitoring scans

## PCI-DSS Compliance The system addresses two critical PCI-DSS requirements: ### Requirement 10.5: Secure Audit Trails The `secureAuditTrail.ts` component implements a secure, tamper-evident audit trail system with: - Cryptographic protection (SHA-256 hashin

g)

- Chain-of-custody tracking for log events
- Integrity verification mechanisms
- Secure log storage and rotation
- Audit access controls ### Requirement 10.6: Log Review The `logReviewer.ts` component implements automated log review with: - Regular automated reviews (every 12 hour

s)
- Anomaly detection in security logs
- Correlation of security events across systems
- Alert generation for suspicious patterns
- Detailed review reports

## Scan Types The system supports multiple scan types: 1. **CORE**: Basic security scan of all component

s

2. **DEPENDENCY**: Scan for outdated or vulnerable dependencies

3. **AUTH**: Authentication security checks

4. **API**: API security scanning

5. **COMPLIANCE**: PCI-DSS and other compliance checks

6. **MALWARE**: Scanning for malicious code patterns

7. **INPUT_VALIDATION**: Checking for input validation issues

8. **ML_SECURITY**: Machine learning-based security analysis

## Scan Scheduling Scans can be scheduled with different frequencies: - **ONCE**: Run a single tim

e

- **HOURLY**: Run every hour
- **DAILY**: Run once per day
- **WEEKLY**: Run once per week (with specific day selection)
- **MONTHLY**: Run once per month
- **CUSTOM**: Run with a custom cron expression ### Enhanced Scheduling Features The updated security scan system now includes: - **Day Selection for Weekly Scans**: Specify which days of the week to run scan

s
- **Time-of-day Scheduling**: Set specific times for scans to execute
- **Schedule Management UI**: Intuitive interface in the admin dashboard for managing scan schedules
- **Status Monitoring**: Visual indicators of scan schedule status (active/disabled)
- **Detailed Description Display**: Clear descriptions of scan types and purposes

## Usage ### API Endpoints - `GET /api/security/scan/queue`: Get the current scan queue statu

s

- `POST /api/security/scan`: Schedule a new security scan
- `GET /api/security/scan/:id`: Get status of a specific scan
- `DELETE /api/security/scan/:id`: Cancel a specific scan
- `GET /api/security/scan/schedules`: List all scheduled scans
- `POST /api/security/scan/schedule`: Create a new scan schedule
- `POST /api/security/scan/schedule/:id/toggle`: Enable or disable a scan schedule
- `DELETE /api/security/scan/schedule/:id`: Delete a scan schedule ### Direct Function Call

s

```typescript
// Initialize the system

initializeSecurityScanQueue();

// Queue a scan with high priority

enqueueSecurityScan(ScanType.CORE, true, { priority: 10 });

// Schedule a daily dependency scan

createScheduledScan(
 ScanType.DEPENDENCY,
 ScanFrequency.DAILY,
 {
 deep: false,
 description: 'Daily dependency check',
 time: '03:00'
 }
);

// Schedule a weekly scan on specific days

createScheduledScan(
 ScanType.COMPLIANCE,
 ScanFrequency.WEEKLY,
 {
 description: 'Weekly compliance check',
 time: '02:30',
 daysOfWeek: [1, 4] // Monday and Thursday
 }
);

// Toggle a schedule's active state

toggleScheduleState(scheduleId, false); // Disable a schedule

// Get all scan schedules

const schedules = await getSecurityScanSchedules();

// Delete a scheduled scan

deleteScheduledScan(scheduleId);
```

## Implementation Details - The security scan queue ensures scans run sequentially, preventing resource contentio

n

- System resource monitoring prevents scans from overloading the server
- The secure audit trail implements cryptographic chaining to prevent tampering
- Log reviewer performs pattern analysis to detect potential security incidents
- Background scan scheduler handles timing of regular security checks

## Verification The implementation has been verified to successfully address the PCI-DSS compliance warnings by: 1. Implementing secure audit trails with tamper-evident loggin

g

2. Implementing automated log review with anomaly detection

3. Documenting all security findings with detailed reports

4. Integrating with the existing security infrastructure

## Recent Enhancements The following features have been recently added: 1. **Improved UI for Security Dashboard**: Enhanced visualization of scan results and schedule

s

2. **Advanced Scheduling Options**: Added support for day selection and time specification

3. **Detailed Scan Type Information**: Added comprehensive descriptions for all scan types

4. **Visual Status Indicators**: Improved status display for active/inactive scans

5. **Schedule Management**: Added ability to toggle and delete schedules through UI

## Next Steps Potential enhancements to consider: 1. **Advanced Reporting**: Create exportable reports with detailed analytics of scan finding

s

2. **Scan Result Comparison**: Implement comparison views for historical scan results 3. **Contextual Security Recommendations**: Provide AI-powered remediation suggestions for identified issues

4. **Scan Performance Metrics**: Track and display scan performance and resource utilization

5. **User-Defined Custom Scans**: Allow administrators to define custom scan configurations
