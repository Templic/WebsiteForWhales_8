# Documentation Planning Proces

s

**Version:** 1.0 **Last Updated:** 2025-05-17 **Status:** Active **AI-Index:** the structured approach to planning documentation throughout the development lifecycle, detailing how to assess documentation needs, assign responsibilities, establish timelines, and conduct reviews. It provides frameworks for identifying documentation requirements, prioritizing documentation tasks, and ensuring all technical components are adequately documented. The document serves as a guide for technical teams to systematically plan documentation efforts that align with development milestones and meet quality standards.

## Overview The Documentation Planning Process defines how we approach the planning and scheduling of documentation work throughout the development lifecycle. This process ensures that documentation is created proactively and strategically rather than as an afterthough

t.

## Documentation Needs Assessment ### When to Conduct Assessment Documentation needs should be assessed at these key points: 1. **Project Initiation** - During the planning phase of any new projec

t

2. **Major Feature Development** - Before beginning work on significant features

3. **API or Interface Changes** - When modifying public APIs or interfaces

4. **Quarterly Review** - Regular assessment of documentation coverage

5. **User Feedback Analysis** - When patterns emerge from user feedback ### Assessment Framework Use this framework to assess documentation needs: | Aspect | Questions to Consider | Priorit

y |

|--------|------------------------|---------|

| **User Types** | Who will use this feature/component? What is their technical level? | High |
| **Use Cases** | What tasks will users perform? What workflows need documentation? | High |

| **Complexity** | How complex is the feature? Are there non-obvious aspects? | Medium |
| **Risk Areas** | What aspects are error-prone or security-sensitive? | High |

| **Dependencies** | What other components/systems interact with this one? | Medium |

### Documentation Types Matrix Based on the assessment, determine which documentation types are needed: | Documentation Type | When to Create | Target Audienc

e |

|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|

| Conceptual Guide | New concepts, complex topics | All users |
| Tutorial | Common tasks, getting started | New users |

| How-To Guide | Specific procedures | Regular users |
| Reference | API details, parameters, return values | Developers |

| Troubleshooting | Common errors, edge cases | Support, advanced users |
| Architecture | System design, component interactions | Developers, architects |

## Responsibility Assignment ### RACI Matrix Use this RACI matrix to assign documentation responsibilities: | Role | Responsibilit

y |

|------|----------------|

| **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** | Responsible for technical accuracy |
| **Technical Writer** | Responsible for creating content and ensuring quality |

| **UX Designer** | Consulted for workflow documentation and screenshots |
| **Product Manager** | Accountable for prioritization and scope |

| **QA Engineer** | Consulted for validation and edge cases |
| **Documentation Lead** | Accountable for overall documentation quality |

### Documentation Team Structure For larger projects, consider forming a documentation team: 1. **Documentation Lead** - Coordinates all documentation effort

s

2. **Technical Writers** - Create and edit documentation

3. **Subject Matter Experts** - Provide technical expertise

4. **Reviewers** - Validate accuracy and usability

## Timeline Planning ### Integration with Development Lifecycle Documentation planning should be integrated into the development lifecycle: 1. **Requirements Phase** - Identify documentation needs - Assign responsibilities - Create documentation plan 2. **Design Phase** - Document architecture decisions - Create conceptual guides - Plan user documentation 3. **Implementation Phase** - Create API reference documentation - Update developer guides - Document code examples 4. **Testing Phase** - Validate documentation accuracy - Create troubleshooting guides - Update based on testing feedback 5. **Release Phase** - Finalize all documentation - Create release notes - Update training materials ### Sample Documentation Schedule Here's a sample schedule for a three-month project: | Week | Documentation Tasks | Dependencies | Owne

r |

|------|---------------------|--------------|-------|

| 1-2 | Documentation plan creation | Project plan | Doc Lead |
| 2-3 | Architecture documentation | Design specs | Architect |

| 4-6 | API reference (first draft) | API design | Tech Writer |
| 6-8 | User tutorials | UI implementation | Tech Writer |

| 8-10 | Developer guides | Code completion | SME |
| 10-11 | Troubleshooting guides | QA testing | QA + Writer |

| 11-12 | Final review and publication | All docs complete | Doc Lead |

## Review Cycles ### Documentation Review Process All documentation should go through this review process: 1. **Self-Review** - Author reviews for clarity, completeness, and accurac

y

2. **Technical Review** - SME validates technical accuracy

3. **Editorial Review** - Writer checks style, formatting, and readability

4. **User Testing** - Test with representative users if possible

5. **Final Approval** - Documentation lead approves for publication ### Review Checklist Use this checklist during reviews: - [ ] Follows documentation standard

s

- [ ] All required sections are present
- [ ] Technical information is accurate
- [ ] Examples are complete and work as described
- [ ] Links to related documents are provided
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Diagrams are clear and labeled
- [ ] Screenshots are current
- [ ] No spelling or grammatical errors
- [ ] Metadata is complete and correct

## Documentation Plan Template ### Template Structure A complete documentation plan should includ

e:

```markdown

# Documentation Plan: [Project Nam

e]

## Overvie

w

Brief description of the project and its documentation needs

## Documentation Scop

e

* List of features/components requiring documentation
* Out-of-scope items

## Target Audience

s

* Detailed list of user types and their needs
* Technical level and background assumptions

## Documentation Type

s

* List of document types to be created
* Estimated page count/effort for each

## Responsibilitie

s

* RACI matrix for this specific project
* Key contacts

## Timelin

e

* Documentation milestones
* Dependencies on other project activities
* Review dates

## Approva

l

* Stakeholder sign-off requirements
* Approval process

```

## Best Practices 1. **Start Early** - Begin documentation planning as soon as project planning start

s

2. **Involve Stakeholders** - Include all relevant roles in planning

3. **Be Realistic** - Allocate sufficient time for documentation tasks

4. **Prioritize** - Focus on high-impact documentation first

5. **Create Templates** - Use standardized templates to speed up creation

6. **Track Progress** - Monitor documentation completion against the plan

7. **Get Feedback** - Collect user feedback to improve future documentation

## Common Challenges and Solutions | Challenge | Solutio

n |

|-----------|----------|

| Limited SME availability | Schedule short, focused interview sessions |
| Changing features | Build flexibility into the plan; document stable aspects first |

| Time constraints | Prioritize critical documentation; use templates |
| Technical complexity | Break down into smaller topics; use diagrams |

| Outdated documentation | Implement regular review cycles |
