## Overview Our application uses a multi-layered security approach to protect against web attacks. We've built several lines of defense that work together to keep your data and systems safe. ### What This Means For You - **For Developers**: Clear security patterns to follow in your cod

e

- **For Administrators**: Tools to monitor and enhance security
- **For Users**: Protection of sensitive data and account information ### Defense-in-Depth Strategy Rather than relying on a single security measure, we use multiple protective layers: ![Security Layers](../static/images/security-layers-diagram.png) | Security Layer | What It Protects Against | Key Component

s |

|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|

| Network Security | External attacks, eavesdropping | WAF, HTTPS, HSTS |
| Application Security | Code exploitation, session attacks | CSRF protection, input validation |

| Data Security | Data breaches, unauthorized access | Encryption, access controls |
| Infrastructure Security | System compromise, privilege escalation | Secure configuration, patching |

## Core Security Measures the main protective measures implemented in our application. ### Content Security Policy (CSP) **What it does:** Prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources browsers can load. **How it help

s:**

- Blocks malicious scripts from running
- Prevents data theft via script injection
- Reduces the impact of successful content injection attacks **Implementation:**

We set up CSP in two places:

1. Express server (via Helmet)

2. Flask server (via Flask-Talisman) > **Important:** Both must be properly configured when integrating external content. See the [CSP Configuration Guide](./CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY.md) for details. <details>

<summary>View Express server configuration</summary>

```javascript
// server/index.ts

app.use(
 helmet({
 contentSecurityPolicy: {
 directives: {
 defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
 scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'",
 "https://*.googleapis.com", "https://*.youtube.com"],
 styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
 imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "blob:", "https://*.googleapis.com",
 "https://*.ytimg.com"],
 connectSrc: ["'self'", "ws:", "wss:"],
 fontSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
 objectSrc: ["'none'"],
 mediaSrc: ["'self'", "https://*.youtube.com"],
 frameSrc: ["'self'", "https://*.youtube.com", "https://maps.google.com"],
 },
 },
 })
);
```

</details> ### HTTPS Enforcement **What it does:** Ensures all communication is encrypted by automatically redirecting HTTP to HTTPS. **How it help

s:**
- Prevents eavesdropping on data in transit
- Protects authentication credentials
- Maintains data integrity during transmission <details>

<summary>View implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/index.ts

app.use((req, res, next) => {
 if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !req.secure) {
 return res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
 }
 next();
});
```

</details> ### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) **What it does:** Controls which domains can access our API. **How it help

s:**
- Prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized API calls
- Allows legitimate integrations while blocking others
- Different settings for development and production environments <details>

<summary>View implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/index.ts

app.use(cors({
 origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
 ? ['https://cosmic-community.replit.app']
 : ['http://localhost:5000', 'http://localhost:3000'],
 credentials: true
}));
```

</details> ### Security Headers **What it does:** Sets HTTP headers that instruct browsers to enable additional protections. **How it help

s:**
- Prevents clickjacking (X-Frame-Options)
- Enables XSS filtering (X-XSS-Protection)
- Prevents MIME type sniffing (X-Content-Type-Options)
- Enforces HTTPS (Strict-Transport-Security) <details>

<summary>View implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/index.ts

app.use(helmet());
```

</details> ### CSRF Protection **What it does:** Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks by requiring special tokens for state-changing operations. **How it help

s:**
- Blocks attacks that trick users into performing unwanted actions
- Protects authenticated sessions from abuse
- Secures form submissions and API calls <details>

<summary>View implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/index.ts

const csrfProtection = csurf({
 cookie: {
 httpOnly: true,
 secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
 sameSite: 'strict'
 }
});

// Token endpoint

app.get('/api/csrf-token', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
 res.json({ csrfToken: req.csrfToken() });
});

// Apply CSRF protection to API routes

app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
 // Skip CSRF protection for the token endpoint
 if (req.path === '/csrf-token') {
 return next();
 }
 csrfProtection(req, res, next);
});
```

</details>

## Authentication and Authorization Our application uses role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive operations and data. ### Role-Based Access Control **What it does:** Restricts access to features based on user roles and specific permissions. **How it help

s:**

- Limits what different user types can do
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Makes security auditing easier
- Ensures least-privilege principle **Role Hierarchy:**

1. **Users** - Regular application users

2. **Admins** - Can view settings and logs

3. **Super Admins** - Can modify settings and run security tools <details>

<summary>View role permissions implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/securityRoutes.ts

enum UserRole {
 USER = 'user',
 ADMIN = 'admin',
 SUPER_ADMIN = 'super_admin'
}

enum SecurityPermission {
 VIEW_SETTINGS = 'view_security_settings',
 MODIFY_SETTINGS = 'modify_security_settings',
 VIEW_LOGS = 'view_security_logs',
 RUN_SCAN = 'run_security_scan',
 VIEW_SCAN_RESULTS = 'view_scan_results'
}

const rolePermissions: Record<UserRole, SecurityPermission[]> = {
 [UserRole.USER]: [],
 [UserRole.ADMIN]: [
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_SETTINGS,
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_LOGS,
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_SCAN_RESULTS
 ],
 [UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN]: [
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_SETTINGS,
 SecurityPermission.MODIFY_SETTINGS,
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_LOGS,
 SecurityPermission.RUN_SCAN,
 SecurityPermission.VIEW_SCAN_RESULTS
 ]
};
```

</details> ### Permission Checking **What it does:** Verifies user permissions before allowing access to protected resources. **How it help

s:**
- Consistently enforces permission rules
- Logs access attempts for security monitoring
- Provides clear feedback on permission errors **When to use it:** Wrap any sensitive route with this middleware. Example:

```javascript
// Example usage

router.get('/api/security/settings',
 checkPermission(SecurityPermission.VIEW_SETTINGS),
 getSecuritySettings
);
``` <details>
<summary>View permission middleware implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/securityRoutes.ts

const checkPermission = (requiredPermission: SecurityPermission) => {
 return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
 const userRole = req.session?.user?.role as UserRole;

 // Check if user is authenticated
 if (!userRole) {
 logSecurityEvent({
 type: 'UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT',
 details: `Unauthenticated user attempted to access ${req.path}`,
 ip: req.ip,
 userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
 path: req.path,
 method: req.method,
 severity: 'medium'
 });

 return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication required' });
 }

 // Check if user has required permission
 const hasPermission = rolePermissions[userRole]?.includes(requiredPermission);

 if (!hasPermission) {
 logSecurityEvent({
 type: 'PERMISSION_DENIED',
 details: `User with role ${userRole} attempted to access resource requiring ${requiredPermission}`,
 userId: req.session?.user?.id,
 userRole,
 ip: req.ip,
 userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
 path: req.path,
 method: req.method,
 severity: 'high'
 });

 return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Insufficient permissions' });
 }

 // User has required permission, proceed
 next();
 };
};
```

</details> ### Authentication Flow Our authentication system follows this secure process: 1. **Login Request** - User submits credential

s

2. **Credential Validation** - Server verifies username and password

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Optional second verification step

4. **Session Creation** - Secure session established

5. **Authorization** - Role and permissions applied

6. **Audit Logging** - Authentication events recorded For implementation details, see the [Authentication System Documentation](./AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM.md).

## Rate Limiting **What it does:** Controls how many requests users can make to our API in a given time period. **How it help

s:**

- Prevents brute force attacks on login systems
- Protects against denial of service attacks
- Prevents API abuse and resource exhaustion
- Ensures fair access for all users ### Tiered Rate Limiting We apply different rate limits based on the sensitivity of each endpoint: | Endpoint Type | Request Limit | Time Window | Reaso

n |

|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------|

| Authentication | 5 requests | 15 minutes | Prevent credential stuffing attacks |
| Admin Operations | 20 requests | 1 minute | Protect sensitive administrative functions |

| Public API | 60 requests | 1 minute | Allow reasonable public usage |
| Default API | 30 requests | 1 minute | General protection for all other endpoints |

<details>
<summary>View implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/middleware/rateLimit.ts
// Apply rate limiting to different routes based on their purposes

app.use('/api/auth', authLimiter); // Stricter limits for authentication endpoints

app.use('/api/admin', adminLimiter); // Admin operations get their own rate limit

app.use('/api/public', publicLimiter); // Public API endpoints get more generous limits

app.use('/api', defaultLimiter); // Default rate limiting for all other API routes
```

</details> ### Rate Limit Response When a rate limit is exceeded, the API return

s:
- HTTP status code 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Header indicating when the limit resets
- Clear error message explaining the limit For more detailed configuration, see [Rate Limiting System](./RATE-LIMITING-SYSTEM.md).

## Input Validation **What it does:** Verifies that all data coming into the application meets our requirements before processing. **How it help

s:**

- Prevents injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command injection)
- Blocks malformed data that could crash the application
- Ensures data integrity in the database
- Provides clear error messages to users ### Validation Framework We use Zod (a TypeScript-first validation library) to create schemas that define exactly what data should look like: ![Input Validation Flow](../static/images/input-validation-flow.png) ### Example Validation Process 1. Define schema with specific rule

s

2. Apply schema to incoming data

3. Handle validation failures with proper error responses

4. Process validated data safely <details>

<summary>View validation example</summary>

```javascript
// Example from server/securityRoutes.ts

const schema = z.object({
 setting: z.string()
 .min(3, 'Setting name must be at least 3 characters')
 .max(100, 'Setting name must be at most 100 characters')
 .refine(
 (val) => Object.keys(defaultSecuritySettings).includes(val),
 { message: 'Invalid security setting name' }
 ),
 value: z.boolean({
 required_error: 'Value must be a boolean',
 invalid_type_error: 'Value must be a boolean'
 })
});

const validationResult = schema.safeParse(req.body);

if (!validationResult.success) {
 // Log validation failure
 logSecurityEvent({
 type: 'SECURITY_SETTING_VALIDATION_FAILED',
 // ...more details
 });

 return res.status(400).json({
 message: 'Invalid input',
 errors: validationResult.error.errors
 });
}
```

</details> ### Validation Best Practices 1. **Whitelist Approach**: Only accept known-good values rather than trying to block bad one

s

2. **Strict Type Checking**: Ensure data is the correct type (string, number, boolean, etc.)

3. **Length Restrictions**: Limit string length to prevent buffer overflows and DoS attacks

4. **Format Validation**: Check that data follows required patterns (email, phone number, etc.)

5. **Custom Validators**: Use custom functions for complex validation logic For more details, see our [Validation Framework Documentation](./VALIDATION-FRAMEWORK.md).

## Error Handling **What it does:** Provides a consistent way to handle errors across the application. **How it help

s:**

- Presents user-friendly error messages
- Prevents sensitive information leakage
- Creates detailed logs for troubleshooting
- Maintains a consistent API response format ### Security Benefits Proper error handling is crucial for security because: 1. **Prevents Information Exposure** - Detailed error messages in production could reveal implementation details to attacker

s

2. **Logs Security Events** - Creates audit trail of potential security issues

3. **Ensures Proper Response Codes** - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for security events

4. **Maintains User Experience** - Provides helpful messages without exposing sensitive details ### Error Response Structure Our standard error response forma

t:

```json
{
 "success": false,
 "message": "User-friendly error message",
 "code": "ERROR_CODE" // Optional error code
}
``` <details>
<summary>View error handler implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/middleware/errorHandler.ts
// Global error handler middleware

export const errorHandler = (err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
 // Log the error
 console.error(`${err.name || 'Error'}: ${err.message}`);
 if (err.stack) {
 console.error(err.stack);
 }

 // Log to file
 logError(err, req);

 // Set default values for status and message
 const statusCode = err.statusCode || err.status || 500;

 // Format the error response based on environment
 const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
 const response: any = {
 success: false,
 message: err.message || 'Internal Server Error'
 };

 // Add error code if available
 if (err.code) {
 response.code = err.code;
 }

 // Include error details if available
 if (err.data) {
 response.data = err.data;
 }

 // Include stack trace only in development
 if (isDev && err.stack) {
 response.stack = err.stack.split('\n').map((line: string) => line.trim());
 }

 // Handle specific error types
 // ...

 // Send the response
 res.status(statusCode).json(response);
};
```

</details> ### Development vs. Production Error handling changes based on environment: | Environment | Stack Traces | Detailed Errors | Log Leve

l |

|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Development | ✓ Included | ✓ Detailed | Debug |

| Testing | ✓ Included | ✓ Detailed | Info |
| Production | ✗ Excluded | ✗ Generic | Error |

### Error Handling Best Practices 1. **Use try/catch blocks** for all asynchronous cod

e

2. **Create custom error classes** for different error types

3. **Include error codes** for easier troubleshooting

4. **Log security-relevant errors** using the security logging system

5. **Sanitize error messages** before returning them to users

## Security Dashboard **What it does:** Provides an administrative interface for monitoring and managing security settings. **How it help

s:**

- Centralizes security management in one place
- Makes security status visible at a glance
- Allows quick responses to security issues
- Tracks security improvements over time ### Dashboard Features ![Security Dashboard](../static/images/security-dashboard-overview.png) | Feature | Purpose | Access Leve

| Security Scanner | Run on-demand vulnerability scans | Super Admin |
| Scan Results | View findings from security scans | Admin, Super Admin |

| Security Score | Track overall security posture | Admin, Super Admin |
| Threat Map | Visualize attack patterns and sources | Admin, Super Admin |

### Key Metrics Tracked The dashboard monitors these critical security metrics: 1. **Security Score** - Overall security health (0-10

0)

2. **Open Vulnerabilities** - Count by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

3. **Average Time to Fix** - How quickly issues are addressed

4. **Failed Login Attempts** - Potential brute force attacks

5. **Suspicious Activities** - Anomalous behavior detected ### Access Control The security dashboard implements strict access controls: - Only authenticated administrators can access i

t

- Different features are available based on role
- All actions in the dashboard are logged
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication For detailed usage instructions, see [Security Dashboard Guide](./SECURITY-DASHBOARD-GUIDE.md).

## Security Scanning **What it does:** Automatically checks for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and best practice violations. **How it help

s:**

- Identifies security issues before attackers do
- Validates that security controls are working properly
- Provides a systematic approach to vulnerability management
- Tracks security improvements over time ### Scan Types Our security scanning system includes several types of scans: | Scan Type | What It Checks | Frequenc

y |

|-----------|----------------|-----------|

| Dependency Scan | Outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities | Weekly |
| Static Code Analysis | Common coding vulnerabilities | On deployment |

| Secret Detection | Hardcoded credentials or API keys | Daily |
| Configuration Scan | Security header and setting verification | On deployment |

| API Security Scan | API validation and authentication issues | Weekly |
| Database Scan | SQL injection vulnerabilities | Monthly |

### Vulnerability Categories The scanner looks for these common security issues: 1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Outdated packages with known CVE

s

2. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens

3. **Missing Protections** - Absence of required security headers, CSRF tokens

4. **Input Validation Gaps** - Insufficient validation that could lead to injection attacks

5. **Access Control Issues** - Missing authorization checks or permissions

6. **Configuration Problems** - Insecure settings or options ### Scan Process ![Security Scan Process](../static/images/security-scan-flow.png) 1. **Initialization** - Set up scan parameters and contex

t

2. **Discovery** - Identify files, endpoints, and components to scan

3. **Analysis** - Examine targets for vulnerabilities

4. **Verification** - Confirm findings are valid (reduce false positives)

5. **Reporting** - Generate structured results

6. **Remediation Guidance** - Suggest fixes for identified issues <details>

<summary>View scan implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/securityScan.ts

export async function scanProject(): Promise<SecurityScanResult> {
 const vulnerabilities: SecurityVulnerability[] = [];

 // Initialize counters
 let criticalIssues = 0;
 let highIssues = 0;
 let mediumIssues = 0;
 let lowIssues = 0;

 try {
 // 1. Check for outdated dependencies
 await checkDependencies(vulnerabilities);

 // 2. Check for secrets in code
 await checkForSecrets(vulnerabilities);

 // 3. Check for security headers in responses
 await checkSecurityHeaders(vulnerabilities);

 // 4. Check for proper CSRF protection
 await checkCSRFProtection(vulnerabilities);

 // 5. Check for input validation
 await checkInputValidation(vulnerabilities);

 // Count issues by severity and return results
 // ...
 } catch (error) {
 // Handle errors
 // ...
 }
}
```

</details> ### Scan Results Results are categorized by severity: - **Critical** - Immediate risk of system compromis

e
- **High** - Significant risk requiring prompt attention
- **Medium** - Moderate risk requiring planned remediation
- **Low** - Minor issues to address during normal development For detailed information about the scanning system, see [Security Scan System](./SECURITY-SCAN-SYSTEM.md) and [Security Scan User Guide](./SECURITY-SCAN-USER-GUIDE.md).

## Security Logging **What it does:** Records security-relevant events for monitoring, analysis, and incident response. **How it help

s:**

- Creates audit trails for user actions and system events
- Enables detection of attacks in progress
- Facilitates incident investigation
- Provides evidence for forensic analysis ### Logging Structure Our security events are structured with these key components: - **Timestamp** - When the event occurre

d
- **Event Type** - Category of security event (e.g., LOGIN_ATTEMPT, PERMISSION_CHANGE)
- **Severity** - Importance level (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Details** - Description of what happened
- **Context Information** - User IDs, IP addresses, request paths, etc. ### Log Storage Security logs ar

e:
- Stored in a dedicated directory (`/logs/security/`)
- Automatically rotated when they reach 10MB in size
- Retained with a 5-file rotation policy
- Preserved in JSON format for machine processing <details>

<summary>View logging implementation</summary>

```javascript
// server/security.ts

export function logSecurityEvent(event): void {
 const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
 const logEntry = {
 timestamp,
 ...event,
 };

 const logLine = JSON.stringify(logEntry) + '\n';

 try {
 fs.appendFileSync(securityLogFile, logLine);
 } catch (error) {
 console.error('Failed to write to security log file:', error);
 }

 // Also log to console for monitoring
 console.log(`[SECURITY] ${timestamp} - ${event.type || 'EVENT'}: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`);
}
```

</details> ### Log Rotation To maintain system performance and manage disk space, security logs are automatically rotate

d:

```javascript
// When a log file exceeds 10MB:
// 1. The current log is renamed with a timestamp
// 2. A new log file is created
// 3. Only the 5 most recent log files are kept
``` ### Log Analysis Security logs should be regularly analyzed to: 1. **Identify Patterns** - Look for repeated failed login attempts or unusual access pattern

s

2. **Monitor System Health** - Track security events over time to identify trends 3. **Investigate Incidents** - Use logs to reconstruct the sequence of events during a security incident

4. **Generate Reports** - Create summaries of security posture for stakeholders For monitoring tools and analysis procedures, see the [Security Monitoring Guide](./SECURITY-MONITORING-GUIDE.md).

## Best Practices Below are essential security practices that everyone involved in the application should follow. ### For Developers | Practice | Why It Matters | How To Implemen

t |

|----------|---------------|------------------|

| **Validate All Input** | Prevents injection attacks | Use Zod schemas for all user inputs |
| **Use Permission Middleware** | Ensures proper authorization | Wrap sensitive routes with `checkPermission()` |

| **Log Security Events** | Creates audit trail | Call `logSecurityEvent()` for significant events |
| **Implement Error Handling** | Prevents information leakage | Use `asyncHandler` or try/catch blocks |

| **Secure Sensitive Data** | Protects credentials | Store secrets in environment variables only |
| **Apply Rate Limiting** | Prevents abuse | Add rate limiting to all new endpoints |

| **Use Parameterized Queries** | Prevents SQL injection | Never concatenate strings in SQL queries |
| **Update Dependencies** | Patches vulnerabilities | Run updates with security patches regularly |

| **Enforce CSRF Protection** | Prevents cross-site attacks | Require CSRF tokens for state changes |
| **Run Security Scans** | Finds new vulnerabilities | Schedule automated security scans |

### For Administrators | Practice | Frequency | Benefit

s |

|----------|-----------|----------|

| **Monitor Security Logs** | Daily | Early detection of suspicious activity |
| **Review Security Dashboard** | Weekly | Overall visibility into security posture |

| **Update Security Settings** | Monthly | Adaptation to evolving threat landscape |
| **Schedule Security Scans** | Weekly | Proactive vulnerability discovery |

| **Address Critical Issues** | Immediately | Prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities |

### Security Principle: Defense in Depth Remember that no single security measure is foolproof. Always apply multiple layers of protection: 1. **Prevention** - Stop attacks before they happe

n

2. **Detection** - Identify attacks in progress

3. **Response** - React quickly to security incidents

4. **Recovery** - Restore normal operation after an incident For more detailed security guidelines, refer to the [Comprehensive Security Handbook](./SECURITY-HANDBOOK.md).
