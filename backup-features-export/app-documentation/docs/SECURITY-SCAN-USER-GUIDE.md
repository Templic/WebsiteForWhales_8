## Getting Started ### Accessing the Security Dashboard The security scan system can be accessed through: 1. The API endpoints at `/api/security/scan

s/*`

2. The Security Dashboard UI (if implemented)

3. Direct function calls in code ### Running Your First Scan To run a basic security scan: 1. Make a POST request to `/api/security/scans/run` with the payloa

d:

```json
 {
 "type": "CORE",
 "deep": false
 }


``` 2. The system will return a scan ID that can be used to track progress:

```json
 {
 "success": true,
 "scanId": "0955d13b-a199-4f56-9425-9c3ddcf6f3b7",
 "message": "Scan of type CORE enqueued successfully"
 }


``` 3. Check the status using `/api/security/scans/status`

## Scan Types Explained ### CORE Security Scan **Purpose**: Basic security validation of fundamental security controls and configurations. **When to use**: - After system initializatio

n

- Following major infrastructure changes
- As part of regular security checks **Typical findings**:
- Missing security headers
- Misconfigured security middleware
- Insecure default settings
- Security logging gaps ### API Security Scan **Purpose**: Verification of API endpoint security, including access controls, input validation, and rate limiting. **When to us

e**:
- After adding new API endpoints
- When modifying existing endpoints
- Before exposing APIs to external consumers **Typical findings**:
- Missing authentication on endpoints
- Insufficient rate limiting
- Inadequate input validation
- Insecure response headers ### AUTH Security Scan **Purpose**: Comprehensive check of authentication mechanisms. **When to us

e**:
- After changing authentication flows
- When implementing new authentication methods
- Before enabling new user registration flows **Typical findings**:
- Weak password hashing
- Insecure session management
- Missing multi-factor authentication options
- Authentication bypass possibilities ### DEPENDENCY Security Scan **Purpose**: Analysis of project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and outdated packages. **When to us

e**:
- After installing new dependencies
- Regularly (weekly) to catch new vulnerabilities
- Before deploying to production **Typical findings**:
- Outdated packages with known security issues
- Dependencies with incompatible licenses
- Circular or excessive dependencies
- Abandoned packages ### INPUT Security Scan **Purpose**: Identification of input validation issues that could lead to XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc. **When to us

e**:
- After adding new user input forms
- When modifying data processing logic
- Before accepting user-generated content **Typical findings**:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issues
- SQL injection possibilities
- Command injection risks
- Path traversal vulnerabilities ### COMPLIANCE Security Scan **Purpose**: Verification of compliance with regulations and standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and WCAG. **When to us

e**:
- Before compliance audits
- After changing data handling procedures
- When entering new markets with different regulations **Typical findings**:
- Missing privacy notices
- Inadequate data handling disclosures
- Accessibility issues
- Non-compliant payment handling ### ML Security Scan **Purpose**: Validation of machine learning model security and AI ethics compliance. **When to us

e**:
- After implementing or updating ML models
- Before processing sensitive data with ML
- When training models on new datasets **Typical findings**:
- Model vulnerabilities to adversarial inputs
- Bias in training data or model outputs
- Missing model validation procedures
- Inadequate AI ethics considerations ### ADVANCED Security Scan **Purpose**: Deep analysis of sophisticated security concerns like cryptography, secure coding, and session management. **When to us

e**:
- Before deploying high-security features
- After implementing encryption or hashing
- As part of thorough security reviews **Typical findings**:
- Weak cryptographic implementations
- Insecure coding patterns
- Session fixation vulnerabilities
- Insecure data storage practices

## Scan Depths The system supports two scanning depths: ### Quick Scan (deep: false) - Faster execution tim

e

- Focuses on high-priority issues
- Less resource-intensive
- Good for regular checks ### Deep Scan (deep: true) - Thorough analysi

s
- Identifies subtle issues
- More resource-intensive
- Good for periodic in-depth reviews

## Understanding Scan Results Scan results include: ### Issue Metrics - **Total issues found**: Overall count of identified issue

s

- **Critical issues**: High-severity issues requiring immediate attention
- **High issues**: Serious issues that should be prioritized
- **Medium issues**: Important issues to address in planned work
- **Low issues**: Minor issues to consider in future improvements ### Issue Details Each identified issue include

s:
- Issue type (e.g., "xss", "sql-injection")
- Severity level
- Description of the problem
- File path and line number (where applicable)
- Code snippet or evidence ### Recommendations Actionable suggestions for addressing identified issues, such a

s:
- Code changes to implement
- Configuration updates to apply
- Security practices to adopt
- Libraries or patterns to use

## Security Scan Workflow A typical security scan workflow: 1. **Plan**: Determine which scan types and depths are neede

d

2. **Execute**: Run the selected scans

3. **Review**: Analyze the scan results

4. **Prioritize**: Focus on critical and high-severity issues first

5. **Remediate**: Implement the recommended fixes

6. **Verify**: Re-run scans to confirm issues are resolved

## Best Practices ### Scan Scheduling - Run CORE and API scans dail

y

- Run DEPENDENCY scans weekly
- Run deep scans of all types monthly
- Run targeted scans after relevant code changes ### Issue Remediation - Address critical issues immediatel

y
- Plan remediation of high and medium issues
- Document and track all identified issues
- Verify fixes with follow-up scans ### Performance Considerations - Schedule intensive scans during off-peak hour

s
- Monitor system resources during scans
- Consider scan impact on production systems
- Use quick scans for routine checks

## Advanced Usage ### Scheduling Recurring Scans To set up a recurring sca

n:

```javascript

fetch('/api/security/scans/schedule', {
 method: 'POST',
 headers: {
 'Content-Type': 'application/json',
 },
 body: JSON.stringify({
 type: 'DEPENDENCY',
 schedule: '0 0 * * 0', // Weekly at midnight on Sunday (cron format)
 deep: true,
 tags: ['production', 'dependencies'],
 persistResults: true
 })
});
``` ### Scan Queue Management To clear the scan queue in case of issue

s:

```javascript

fetch('/api/security/scans/clear-queue', {
 method: 'POST'
});
``` ### Direct Code Integration For programmatic use in your applicatio

n:

```typescript

import { enqueueSecurityScan, ScanType, ScanSource } from './security/securityScanQueue';

// After a significant code change or deployment

function onDeployComplete() {
 // Run a targeted scan
 enqueueSecurityScan(ScanType.API, true, ScanSource.SYSTEM);
}
```

## Troubleshooting ### Common Issues 1. **Scan never completes** - Check system resources - Look for errors in the logs - Cancel and restart the scan 2. **Too many issues reported** - Focus on critical and high-severity issues first - Filter results by specific directories or components - Use quick scans for initial assessment 3. **False positives** - Document verified false positives - Consider refining scan patterns - Focus on issues with concrete evidenc
