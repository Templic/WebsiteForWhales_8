# Dependency Management Guid

e

 the procedures for keeping dependencies up-to-date and secure in the project.

## Automated Dependency Updates The project includes automated tools to help manage dependencies and identify security vulnerabilities. ### Using the Dependency Update Script A Node.js script is available to automate the process of checking for outdated dependencies, updating them, and running security audit

s:

```bash

node scripts/update-dependencies.js
``` This script will:

1. Check for outdated packages

2. Run a security audit to identify vulnerabilities

3. Update dependencies to their latest compatible versions

4. Run a post-update security audit to verify which vulnerabilities were fixed

5. Generate a detailed log file in `logs/dependency-updates.log` ### CI/CD Integration (GitHub) For GitHub deployments, a workflow file is included at `.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml` that: 1. Runs automatically every Monday at 1:00 A

M

2. Can be triggered manually when needed

3. Creates a pull request with the updated dependencies

4. Includes audit results in the PR description

## Manual Dependency Management For manual dependency management, follow these steps: ### Checking for Outdated Dependencie

s

```bash

npm outdated
``` This will show a list of outdated packages with their current, wanted, and latest versions. ### Running Security Audit

s

```bash

npm audit
``` This will check your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. ### Updating Dependencies To update all dependencies to their latest compatible version

s:

```bash

npm update
``` To update a specific package:

```bash

npm update package-name
``` ### Fixing Vulnerabilities To fix vulnerabilities that have available remediation

s:

```bash

npm audit fix
``` For vulnerabilities that require major version updates:

```bash

npm audit fix --force
``` ⚠️ Use `--force` with caution as it may break your application due to incompatible changes.

## Best Practices 1. **Regular Updates**: Run dependency updates at least monthl

y

2. **Verify After Updates**: Always test the application after updating dependencies

3. **Review Major Version Updates**: Carefully review changes for major version updates

4. **Keep Security Logs**: Retain logs of security audits and updates

5. **Monitor Security Bulletins**: Subscribe to security bulletins for critical dependencies

## Troubleshooting ### Common Issues 1. **Breaking Changes**: If updates introduce breaking changes, consult the package's changelog and make necessary code adjustment

s

2. **Peer Dependencies**: If you encounter peer dependency warnings, you may need to manually install compatible versions

3. **Audit Errors**: If npm audit reports errors, try clearing the npm cache with `npm cache clean --force` For persistent issues, consult the documentation for the specific package causing problems.
