## Quantum Computing Threat Assessment ### Current Quantum Computing Landscape As of 2025, quantum computers have reached approximately 1,000-1,500 physical qubits, but the number of logical qubits (error-corrected qubits) remains much lower. Current estimates suggest that breaking RSA-2048 would require approximately 20 million qubits with low error rates, which is still years away. ### Timeline Predictions | Milestone | Estimated Timeline | Cryptographic Impac

t |

|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|

| 4,000+ physical qubits | 2026-2027 | Research-level attacks on some mathematical problems |
| 10,000+ physical qubits | 2028-2030 | Potential threat to smaller key sizes in classical crypto |

| 100,000+ physical qubits | 2030-2035 | Serious threat to most classical public key cryptography |
| 1,000,000+ physical qubits | 2035+ | Complete compromise of RSA, ECC, and DH |
