    Parallelize Initializations:
        Implement a mechanism to initialize database connection pooling and background services concurrently to reduce startup time.
        Use Promise.all() to handle parallel execution of these initializations, ensuring that each completes independently.

    Run Security Scans in Parallel:
        Move the security scanning process to start alongside the server. This can be achieved by triggering the security scans asynchronously right after the server starts listening for requests.

    Lazy Load Modules:
        Refactor the code to require modules only when needed. For instance, move module imports into functions where they are necessary, allowing them to load at runtime instead of startup.

    Defer Non-Essential Tasks:
        Delay initialization of logging and analytics. Instead, call these functions after the server has started and is ready to handle requests.

    Implement Connection Pooling:
        Ensure that your database uses a connection pool. If not already implemented, modify the database connection code to use a pooling library or functionality that reduces overhead.

    Optimize Imports:
        Review current imports and clean up the code by removing any unused packages. This can help decrease startup time and improve maintainability.

    Implement Caching:
        Use an in-memory cache (like Redis) to store frequently accessed data during initialization, preventing repeated database queries for the same data.

    Set Concurrency Limits:
        Configure database connection pooling to limit the number of concurrent connections during startup. This will prevent overwhelming the database and manage resources effectively.

    Batch Initialization:
        Group related configuration settings or services so that they can be initialized together. For example, service configurations that are logically related can be handled in one function.

    Health Checks:
        Introduce health checks for critical services (like database connections and external APIs). These checks can run asynchronously to validate service status before completing the server startup.

    Optimize Static Assets:
        Preload critical static assets during initialization. Implement caching strategies to store these assets, enabling quick delivery when the server begins handling requests.

    Asynchronous Initialization:
        Utilize asynchronous functions for any initialization tasks that can run independently. This will keep the server responsive during the startup phase.
