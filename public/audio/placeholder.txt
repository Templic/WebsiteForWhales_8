These placeholder audio files are expected by the BreathSyncPlayer component:

1. meditation-alpha.mp3 - Alpha waves for meditation
2. theta-waves.mp3 - Theta waves for relaxation
3. delta-waves.mp3 - Delta waves for deep sleep
4. alpha-focus.mp3 - Alpha waves for focus

If you have access to these audio files, please place them in this directory.
Otherwise, the component will still function but without actual audio playback.
